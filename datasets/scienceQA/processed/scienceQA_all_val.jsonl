Choose the most likely ratio.\n\nOptions:\nA. 3:1\nB. 4:0\nC. 0:4\nD. 1:3\nE. 2:2","answer":"C","answer_text":"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow pods or green pods, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. The question tells you that the d allele, which is for yellow pods, is recessive to the D allele, which is for green pods.\nYellow pods is the recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the recessive version of the pod color trait must have only recessive alleles for the pod color gene. So, offspring with yellow pods must have the genotype dd.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype dd.\nGreen pods is the dominant allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the dominant version of the pod color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the pod color gene. So, offspring with green pods must have the genotype DD or Dd.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype DD or Dd.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow pods to offspring with green pods is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with yellow pods. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with green pods.","choices":["3:1","4:0","0:4","1:3","2:2"]}

Choose the most likely ratio.\n\nOptions:\nA. 4:0\nB. 3:1\nC. 0:4\nD. 2:2\nE. 1:3","answer":"A","answer_text":"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have Bekko patterning, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the Bekko patterning trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for having Bekko patterning, is dominant over the b allele, which is for not having Bekko patterning.\nNot having Bekko patterning is the recessive allele's version of the Bekko patterning trait. A koi fish with the recessive version of the Bekko patterning trait must have only recessive alleles for the Bekko patterning gene. So, offspring that do not have Bekko patterning must have the genotype bb.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype bb.\nHaving Bekko patterning is the dominant allele's version of the Bekko patterning trait. A koi fish with the dominant version of the Bekko patterning trait must have at least one dominant allele for the Bekko patterning gene. So, offspring that have Bekko patterning must have the genotype BB or Bb.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype BB or Bb.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring that do not have Bekko patterning to offspring that have Bekko patterning is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring that do not have Bekko patterning. This cross is expected to never produce offspring that have Bekko patterning.","choices":["4:0","3:1","0:4","2:2","1:3"]}

The question tells you that the F allele, which is for light yellow flowers, is dominant over the f allele, which is for dark yellow flowers.\nDark yellow flowers is the recessive allele's version of the flower color trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the flower color trait must have only recessive alleles for the flower color gene. So, offspring with dark yellow flowers must have the genotype ff.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.\nLight yellow flowers is the dominant allele's version of the flower color trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the flower color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the flower color gene.

The question tells you that the I allele, which is for a spotted tail, is dominant over the i allele, which is for an unspotted tail.\nAn unspotted tail is the recessive allele's version of the tail spots trait. A guppy with the recessive version of the tail spots trait must have only recessive alleles for the tail spots gene. So, offspring with an unspotted tail must have the genotype ii.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ii.\nA spotted tail is the dominant allele's version of the tail spots trait. A guppy with the dominant version of the tail spots trait must have at least one dominant allele for the tail spots gene. So, offspring with a spotted tail must have the genotype II or Ii.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype II or Ii.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with an unspotted tail to offspring with a spotted tail is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with an unspotted tail.

The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a dwarf body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body.\nA normal-sized body is the dominant allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the dominant version of the body size trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body size gene.

The question tells you that the L allele, which is for white wool, is dominant over the l allele, which is for black wool.\nWhite wool is the dominant allele's version of the wool color trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the wool color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wool color gene.

The question tells you that the A allele, which is for not having albinism, is dominant over the a allele, which is for having albinism.\nHaving albinism is the recessive allele's version of the albinism trait. A rat with the recessive version of the albinism trait must have only recessive alleles for the albinism gene. So, offspring that have albinism must have the genotype aa.\nThere is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype aa. This box is highlighted below.\nNot having albinism is the dominant allele's version of the albinism trait. A rat with the dominant version of the albinism trait must have at least one dominant allele for the albinism gene. So, offspring that do not have albinism must have the genotype AA or Aa.\nThere are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype AA or Aa. These boxes are highlighted below.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring that have albinism to offspring that do not have albinism is 1:3.

Choose the most likely ratio.\n\nOptions:\nA. 4:0\nB. 1:3\nC. 2:2\nD. 0:4\nE. 3:1","answer":"E","answer_text":"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with bright orange cheeks or pale orange cheeks, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the cheek color trait. The question tells you that the R allele, which is for bright orange cheeks, is dominant over the r allele, which is for pale orange cheeks.\nBright orange cheeks is the dominant allele's version of the cheek color trait. A cockatiel with the dominant version of the cheek color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the cheek color gene. So, offspring with bright orange cheeks must have the genotype RR or Rr.\nThere are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype RR or Rr. These boxes are highlighted below.\nPale orange cheeks is the recessive allele's version of the cheek color trait. A cockatiel with the recessive version of the cheek color trait must have only recessive alleles for the cheek color gene. So, offspring with pale orange cheeks must have the genotype rr.\nThere is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype rr. This box is highlighted below.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with bright orange cheeks to offspring with pale orange cheeks is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with bright orange cheeks for every 1 offspring with pale orange cheeks.","choices":["4:0","1:3","2:2","0:4","3:1"]}
