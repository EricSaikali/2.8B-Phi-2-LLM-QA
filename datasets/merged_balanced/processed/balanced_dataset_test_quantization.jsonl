So, Chanel's phenotype for the fur length trait must be short fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Chanel's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nChanel's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Chanel's phenotype for the fur length trait must be short fur.","choices":["short fur","long fur"],"subject":null}

The question tells you that the h allele, which is for a short stem, is recessive to the H allele, which is for a tall stem.\nA tall stem is the dominant allele's version of the stem height trait. A pea plant with the dominant version of the stem height trait must have at least one dominant allele for the stem height gene. So, offspring with a tall stem must have the genotype HH or Hh.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype HH or Hh.\nA short stem is the recessive allele's version of the stem height trait. A pea plant with the recessive version of the stem height trait must have only recessive alleles for the stem height gene. So, offspring with a short stem must have the genotype hh.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a tall stem to offspring with a short stem is 4:0.

The question tells you that the f allele, which is for long fur, is recessive to the F allele, which is for short fur.\nLong fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur length trait. A Syrian hamster with the recessive version of the fur length trait must have only recessive alleles for the fur length gene. So, offspring with long fur must have the genotype ff.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff. These boxes are highlighted below.\nShort fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur length trait. A Syrian hamster with the dominant version of the fur length trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fur length gene. So, offspring with short fur must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff. These boxes are highlighted below.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with long fur to offspring with short fur is 2:2.

The question tells you that the M allele, which is for having Thomsen disease, is dominant over the m allele, which is for not having Thomsen disease.\nHaving Thomsen disease is the dominant allele's version of the Thomsen disease trait. A human with the dominant version of the Thomsen disease trait must have at least one dominant allele for the Thomsen disease gene. So, offspring that have Thomsen disease must have the genotype MM or Mm.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype MM or Mm. These boxes are highlighted below.\nNot having Thomsen disease is the recessive allele's version of the Thomsen disease trait. A human with the recessive version of the Thomsen disease trait must have only recessive alleles for the Thomsen disease gene.

First, consider the alleles in the plant's genotype for the fruit taste gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for sour fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for sweet fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nThe muskmelon plant's genotype of Ff has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait.

The question tells you that the F allele, which is for axial flowers, is dominant over the f allele, which is for terminal flowers.\nTerminal flowers is the recessive allele's version of the flower position trait. A pea plant with the recessive version of the flower position trait must have only recessive alleles for the flower position gene. So, offspring with terminal flowers must have the genotype ff.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.\nAxial flowers is the dominant allele's version of the flower position trait. A pea plant with the dominant version of the flower position trait must have at least one dominant allele for the flower position gene. So, offspring with axial flowers must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with terminal flowers to offspring with axial flowers is 0:4.

The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.\nBooster's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Booster's phenotype for the horns trait must be having horns.","choices":["having horns","not having horns"],"subject":null}

To find this out, read the passage carefully.\nThe Knipovich Ridge and its rift valley mark the northernmost mid-ocean ridge in the Atlantic Ocean. This mid-ocean ridge and rift valley are the result of the Eurasian Plate and the North American Plate moving away from each other.\nThere are several volcanoes in the rift valley, as well as cracks in the crust called hydrothermal vents. At these vents, cold ocean water sinks into the crust, is heated by hot magma, and rises back to the surface.
