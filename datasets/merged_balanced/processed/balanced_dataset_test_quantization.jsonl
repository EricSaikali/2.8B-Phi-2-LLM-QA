The question tells you that the E allele, which is for red eyes, is dominant over the e allele, which is for black eyes.\nBlack eyes is the recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the recessive version of the eye color trait must have only recessive alleles for the eye color gene. So, offspring with black eyes must have the genotype ee.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.\nRed eyes is the dominant allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the dominant version of the eye color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the eye color gene. So, offspring with red eyes must have the genotype EE or Ee.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 0:4.

A Syrian hamster with the recessive version of the fur length trait must have only recessive alleles for the fur length gene. So, offspring with long fur must have the genotype ff.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.

The question tells you that the N allele, which is for normal wings, is dominant over the n allele, which is for vestigial wings.\nNormal wings is the dominant allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the wing type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wing type gene. So, offspring with normal wings must have the genotype NN or Nn.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype NN or Nn.\nVestigial wings is the recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the wing type trait must have only recessive alleles for the wing type gene. So, offspring with vestigial wings must have the genotype nn.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype nn.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with normal wings to offspring with vestigial wings is 0:4.

Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for straight fur (F) is dominant over the allele for curly fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nJinx's genotype of Ff has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Jinx's phenotype for the fur type trait must be straight fur.","choices":["straight fur","curly fur"],"subject":null}
