Chester's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for soft fur. So, Chester's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be soft fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Chester's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for soft fur (f) is recessive to the allele for rough fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nChester's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait.

The question tells you that the g allele, which is for bush growth, is recessive to the G allele, which is for climbing growth.\nClimbing growth is the dominant allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the growth pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with climbing growth must have the genotype GG or Gg.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype GG or Gg. These boxes are highlighted below.\nBush growth is the recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the growth pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with bush growth must have the genotype gg.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg.

The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a hairy body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a hairless body.\nA hairy body is the dominant allele's version of the body hair trait. A deer mouse with the dominant version of the body hair trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body hair gene. So, offspring with a hairy body must have the genotype BB or Bb.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.\nA hairless body is the recessive allele's version of the body hair trait. A deer mouse with the recessive version of the body hair trait must have only recessive alleles for the body hair gene. So, offspring with a hairless body must have the genotype bb.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a hairy body to offspring with a hairless body is 4:0.

First, consider the alleles in Squeaky's genotype for the albinism gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.\nThe allele for having albinism (a) is recessive to the allele for not having albinism (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.\nSqueaky's genotype of Aa has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Squeaky's phenotype for the albinism trait must be not having albinism.","choices":["having albinism","not having albinism"],"subject":null}
