Most animals' fur grows downward, which helps rainwater run down off the animal. Sloths' fur, however, grows upward. When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body. This helps the sloth dry off more quickly. Sloth fur has another special purpose. Each strand of fur has grooves that collect algae. The algae give the sloth a greenish color, which helps it blend in with its leafy environment.

The question tells you that the g allele, which is for bush growth, is recessive to the G allele, which is for climbing growth.\nBush growth is the recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the growth pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the growth pattern gene.

This rift valley began to form as the North American Plate and the Eurasian Plate moved away from each other. In this picture, you can see the gap that formed during a major plate movement along the rift. Gaps such as this form when the two plates move apart, creating a large crack in the crust. The last time this happened in the Thingvellir Rift Valley was in the spring of 1789. Since then, a walking path was built along the rift valley to allow park visitors to walk along the rift.\nThe underlined part of the passage explains that the Thingvellir Rift Valley formed as the two plates moved away from each other, or diverged.

A fruit fly with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene.

The question tells you that the b allele, which is for blue body feathers, is recessive to the B allele, which is for green body feathers.\nGreen body feathers is the dominant allele's version of the body feather color trait. A budgerigar parakeet with the dominant version of the body feather color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body feather color gene. So, offspring with green body feathers must have the genotype BB or Bb.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype BB or Bb. These boxes are highlighted below.\nBlue body feathers is the recessive allele's version of the body feather color trait. A budgerigar parakeet with the recessive version of the body feather color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body feather color gene. So, offspring with blue body feathers must have the genotype bb.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
