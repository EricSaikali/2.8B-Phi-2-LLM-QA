If we fix a number in a slot, then there are $$4!=24$$ ways to arrange the other numbers, so each number appears in each spot $$24$$ times. Therefore, the sum of all such numbers is $$24\\times (1+3+5+7+8)\\times (11111)=24\\times24\\times11111=6399936$$.  Since there are $$5!=120$$ such numbers, we divide $$6399936\\div120$$~ to get $$53332.8$$.

Case 1: all 4 are colored one color. In that case, all of the remaining sides must be of the other color to not have a triangle where all three sides are of the same color. We can correspondingly fill out each color based on this constraint, but in this case you will always end up with a triangle where all three sides have the same color by inspection.

The balance has two situations: balanced or not.  Analyze the situation of the balance: if balanced, the fake coin is among the remaining $$4$$ coins.  In the second weighing with the balance, randomly take $$3$$ coins from coin $$1$$ to coin $$8$$ and put them on the left end of the balance and randomly take $$3$$ coins from coin $$9$$ to coin $$12$$ and put them on the right end of the balance (such as $$9$$, $$10$$, $$11$$). The balance also has two situations: balanced or not.  If balanced, coin $$12$$ is the coin of different weight. In the third weighing with the balance, comparing No. $$12$$ coin with any other coin, whether the coin is lighter or heavier can be known.  If not, it can be known that the coin of different weight is among the three coins $$9$$, $$10$$, and $$11$$, and that whether it is lighter or heavier than other coins can be known. In the third weighing with the balance, randomly take two of the coins (such as $$9$$ and $$10$$) and put them on the both ends of the balance. If balanced, the remaining coin (coin $$11$$) is the one we are looking for; if not, based on the previous judgement that whether the coin is lighter or heavier, it can be determined that which one of the coins on the balance is what we are looking for.  Analyze the first imbalanced situation as follows:  There are two situations: the right end weighs more or the left end weighs more. Assume the left end weighs more (which is the same for the situation that the right end weighs more.)  In the second weighing with the balance, take off $$3$$ coins randomly from the left end (such as $$1$$, $$2$$, and $$3$$) and move $$3$$ coins from the right end to the left end (such as $$5$$, $$6$$, and $$7$$), then take $$3$$ coins randomly from the $$4$$ coins left in the first weighing (such as $$9$$, $$10$$, and $$11$$) to the right end, and there sees $$3$$ situations for the balance: \u2460 the left end weighs more, \u2461 the two ends strike a balance, \u2462 the right end weighs more. Analyze the situations one by one as follows:  \u2460 If the left end weighs more, the coin we are looking for must be coin $$4$$ or coin $$8$$. In the third time weighing with the balance, take one of the coins (such as coin $$4$$) and put it on the left end of the balance. Randomly take one of the remaining $$10$$ coins and put it on the right end. There are also $$3$$ situations.  $$a$$: If balanced, coin $$8$$ is the one we are looking for. Based on the result of using the balance for the second time, it is known that the coin weighs less than other coins.  $$b$$: If the left end weighs more, coin $$4$$ is the one we are looking for and it weighs more than other coins.  $$c$$: If the right end weighs more, coin $$4$$ is the one we are looking for and it weighs less than other coins.  \u2461 If the two ends strike a balance, the coin we are looking for is among the three coins ($$1$$, $$2$$, and $$3$$) taken from the left end. Since the left end weighs more in the first weighing, it is known that the coin weighs more than other coins. The following analysis is the same as previous one and will not be repeated.  \u2462 If the right end weighs more, the coin we are looking for is among the three coins ($$5$$, $$6$$, and $$7$$) moved from the right end to the left end. Based on the results of weighing in the first two times (the left end weighs more in the first weighing and the right end weighs more in the second weighing), it is known that the coin weighs less than other coins. The following analysis is the same. ", "choices": ["$$1$$ ", "$$2$$ ", "$$3$$ ", "$$4$$ ", "$$5$$ "]}

The balance has two situations: balanced or not.  Analyze the situation of the balance: if balanced, the fake coin is among the remaining $$4$$ coins.  In the second weighing with the balance, randomly take $$3$$ coins from coin $$1$$ to coin $$8$$ and put them on the left end of the balance and randomly take $$3$$ coins from coin $$9$$ to coin $$12$$ and put them on the right end of the balance (such as $$9$$, $$10$$, $$11$$). The balance also has two situations: balanced or not.  If balanced, coin $$12$$ is the coin of different weight. In the third weighing with the balance, comparing No. $$12$$ coin with any other coin, whether the coin is lighter or heavier can be known.  If not, it can be known that the coin of different weight is among the three coins $$9$$, $$10$$, and $$11$$, and that whether it is lighter or heavier than other coins can be known. In the third weighing with the balance, randomly take two of the coins (such as $$9$$ and $$10$$) and put them on the both ends of the balance. If balanced, the remaining coin (coin $$11$$) is the one we are looking for; if not, based on the previous judgement that whether the coin is lighter or heavier, it can be determined that which one of the coins on the balance is what we are looking for.  Analyze the first imbalanced situation as follows:  There are two situations: the right end weighs more or the left end weighs more. Assume the left end weighs more (which is the same for the situation that the right end weighs more.)  In the second weighing with the balance, take off $$3$$ coins randomly from the left end (such as $$1$$, $$2$$, and $$3$$) and move $$3$$ coins from the right end to the left end (such as $$5$$, $$6$$, and $$7$$), then take $$3$$ coins randomly from the $$4$$ coins left in the first weighing (such as $$9$$, $$10$$, and $$11$$) to the right end, and there sees $$3$$ situations for the balance: \u2460 the left end weighs more, \u2461 the two ends strike a balance, \u2462 the right end weighs more. Analyze the situations one by one as follows:  \u2460 If the left end weighs more, the coin we are looking for must be coin $$4$$ or coin $$8$$. In the third time weighing with the balance, take one of the coins (such as coin $$4$$) and put it on the left end of the balance.

Given Dave is $$5$$ years older than Chas, but $$3$$ years older than Benu, we can tell that Benu is $$2$$ years older than Chas. Given also that Anilis $$3$$ years younger than Chas, we can say that the sum of the ages of the four children is $$\\left( -3+2+5=4 \\right) $$ more than four times Chas' age. So four times Chas' age plus four is twenty, and so Chas must be four. So Anil is just $$ 1$$ year old. ", "choices": ["$$1$$ ", "$$4$$ ", "$$5$$ ", "$$6$$ ", "$$9$$ "]}
