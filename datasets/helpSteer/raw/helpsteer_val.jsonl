Have you ever ridden in a cheesebus with ashy children asleep against you, staring at sudden treesmore numerous than project windowsblurring along the highways like confusion giving way to doubt, the heady smell of dried chlorine and musty towels lulling you into the soft timbre of a Midwest falsetto? Tell me what it is to fall in love with a lightskin girl covering the Isley Brothers. I was not two weeks into 21 years old. I had yet to wear a box cutter in my fifth pocket, or see a semi-automatic aimed at my center mass, to feel its dumbness against my spine. My life was uncertain, save for its unlikely length under my control, like the pilot who falls short of what he says, what he says hes all about, all about.

{"prompt":"Background:\n<start of reference>\nWhen I was younger and a lot more naive, I'd tell just about anybody where this body came from. I hung around primarily other people with metaphysical interests, and I thought it was something I could share. Boy did I want to share.\n\nIt worked well until the day a new person came into my life, got to know me long enough to get my story, and publicly claimed my history as their own. In fact, I've had that happen a lot. I've even sat in my living room crying tears of drowning hurt as I watched a very tender memory I'd shared on the internet enacted step for step in a popular cartoon movie that came out a couple of years after the fact.\n\nWell I'm all grown up now, and I've learned that I'm not the center of the universe. It's important when finding the truth about your metaphysical situation you get that straight, because the answers aren't just inside of you. They're inside of everyone else. My history is not any more special than someone else's may be. I just know how to tell it better than many people do is all. Maybe certain people could take a few classes on the fine art of storytelling rather than steal someone else's history. Or something.\n\nThe main reason why I don't want to bore you with too many details here (and I don't) is because these things are only factors that lead to the shaping of my body and my childhood environment. They're not why I was chosen to be a MILAB. They're just factors in my original makeup, the thing that helped me to come into being. These things I'm going to touch on may be why my father did what he did and possibly was chosen for what he may have done. Or my mother. But they're not why *I* was chosen.\n\nOkay. I'm Native American. I don't mean I'm Cherokee and Irish or some other blend, something that only says that I have an ancestor that was Native American but I'm not. No. I'm Native American.

Even with a small bike, all it takes is a small uphill slope to give you a workout. Unlike large Gold Wings and Harleys, as well as some electric bikes, most of us don't have a reverse gear to help.\n\nGallery: Michelin Motorcycle Reverse Patent Drawings\n\n3Photos\n\nMichelin's solution is quite simple. Rather than adding gears or electric motors to the transmission, it's a completely independent system. It attaches to the rear swingarm the same way as the mudguards and license plate holders of many modern motorcycles. It could even be integrated with these parts from the factory. Small electric motors press two or three rollers against the back tire, which then turns the back wheel. These rollers retract from the tire during normal riding. The system even has its own lithium-ion battery, which eliminates the need for big ugly wiring from the bike's main battery.\n\nBeing electric, this device could supply not only a reverse gear but also assistance with forward movement without using the main engine. The patent says the system would move the bike at one kilometer per hour (0.6 miles per hour), and on up to a ten percent slope. That's where the forward option could come in particularly handy.\n\nWhile not everyone would benefit from this option, it would make bikes so equipped more accessible to smaller or weaker riders. People who can only tip-toe a bike would then be able to safely move it without relying on their own foot power to do it. The only problem I see with this system is that many people remove the hardware that sticks out behind the back wheel because it looks ugly. That would remove the reverse system as well.

Can you tell me a bit about your faith and how I can become a better Jew?\nRabbi: Of course, Michel. Judaism is a beautiful faith that has been around for thousands of years. It is based on the belief in one God who created the world and everything in it. Jews believe that they have a special relationship with God and are chosen to be his people. As such, Jews have certain responsibilities, like observing the Sabbath and following Jewish law.\nMichel: That sounds really interesting. I'd like to learn more about Jewish law. What does that involve?\nRabbi: Jewish law, or halakha, governs every aspect of our lives as Jews. It covers everything from how we pray and worship to what we eat and how we dress. Halakha is based on the Torah, which is the first five books of the Hebrew Bible. The Torah contains 613 commandments that Jews are expected to follow.\nMichel: Wow, that's a lot! I'm not sure I could ever remember all of those commandments!\nRabbi: Don't worry, Michel, you don't have to memorize all 613 commandments! Just by living your life according to Jewish values and traditions, you will naturally be following most of them. And as you learn more about Judaism and grow in your faith, you will slowly start to incorporate more of the commandments into your life.\nMichel: That makes sense. I'm also interested in learning more about Jewish traditions and customs. Can you tell me about some of those?\nRabbi: Sure! There are many different Jewish traditions and customs, ranging from religious rituals to cultural practices. Some of the most common traditions include celebrating holidays like Passover and Hanukkah, observing the Sabbath, and circumcised boys becoming Bar or Bat Mitzvah at the age of 13.\nMichel: That sounds like a lot of fun!

The winds first thought is to craft those seeds: vessels when the tree worries shes not enough of a multiplicity, that she will burn into the cosmos. The cosmos is no thought, no worry, more than us, but less than wind, and the wind is only the infinite, not the bodys death, which is, after all, only a particle, but time formless as space. This is only if the wind worries at all. The seed doesnt think she is the doubling ambition of a vessel. In the wind, the idea of the copy is translated by time. We were once that idea.

The winds first thought is to craft those seeds: vessels when the tree worries shes not enough of a multiplicity, that she will burn into the cosmos.

{"prompt":"Read this for context:\nThe Aloe vera plant has been used for thousands of years to heal a variety of conditions, most notably burns, wounds, skin irritations, and constipation. It is grown in subtropical and tropical locations, including South Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Aloe was one of the most frequently prescribed medicines throughout most of the 18th and 19th centuries and it remains one of the most commonly used herbs in the United States today. However, oral use of aloe for constipation is no longer recommended, as it can have severe side effects.\n\nAloe gel, made from the central part of the aloe leaf, is a common household remedy for minor cuts and burns, as well as sunburns. It can be found in many commercial skin lotions and cosmetics. Aloe contains active compounds that may reduce pain and inflammation and stimulate skin growth and repair. It is also an effective moisturizing agent. For this reason, aloe vera gel has gained tremendous popularity for the relief of burns. In one study, burn sites treated with aloe healed completely in less than 16 days compared to 19 days for sites treated with silver sulfadiazine. In a review of the scientific literature, researchers found that patients who were treated with aloe vera healed an average of almost 9 days sooner than those who were not treated with the medicinal plant. However, other studies show mixed results. At least one study found that aloe actually delayed healing. Aloe is best used for minor burns and skin irritations and should never be applied to an open wound.\n\nAlthough aloe is 99 percent water, aloe gel also contains substances known as glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Glycoproteins speed the healing process by stopping pain and inflammation while polysaccharides stimulate skin growth and repair. These substances may also stimulate the immune system.\n\nYour task is to:\nGive me a summary regarding the use of aloe when treating burns.

It wasn't entirely Suzy's fault. He thought he was supposed to fetch the ball when it was hit into the outfield. It was quite a spectacle watching the entire Red Devils team chase Suzy around the ball park trying to retrieve the ball from him. The only problem was that while they were busy chasing Suzy, the base runner was allowed to roam the bases freely. What would have been a single turned into a game winning home run for the opposing team. Luckily, the loss didn't hurt the team's ranking. Nevertheless, Coach Nelson wasn't amused when a local newspaper published photos of the chase and credited Suzy with the game winning RBI for the opposition. In addition, the story mockingly questioned whether or not Suzy was listed on the official roster of players.\n\nCoach Nelson spotted us as soon as we stepped through the admittance gate.

{"prompt":"The reference text below provides context for the following instruction:\nPolemon of Athens (, fl. 2nd century BC) was an ancient Greek Stoic philosopher and geographer. Of Athenian citizenship, he was most widely known as Polemon of Athens, but he was born either in Ilium, Samos, or Sicyon, and was also known as Polemon of Ilium and Polemon Periegetes. He traveled throughout Greece and wrote about the places he visited. He also compiled a collection of the epigrams he saw on the monuments and votive offerings. None of these works survive, but many later writers quote from them.\n\nLife\nPolemon was the son of Euegetes, and he was a contemporary of Aristophanes of Byzantium and Ptolemy Epiphanes.  He was a follower of the Stoic philosopher Panaetius. He made extensive journeys throughout Greece to collect materials for his geographical works, in the course of which he paid particular attention to the inscriptions on votive offerings and on columns, whence he obtained the surname of Stelokopas.\n\nWorks\nIn his travels, Polemon collected the epigrams he found into a work On the inscriptions to be found in cities (). In addition, other works of his are mentioned, upon the votive offerings and monuments in the Acropolis of Athens, at Lacedaemon, at Delphi, and elsewhere, which no doubt contained copies of numerous epigrams. His works may have been a chief source of the Garland of Meleager. Athenaeus, Sextus Julius Africanus and other writers make very numerous quotations from his works. They were chiefly descriptions of different parts of Greece; some are on paintings preserved in various places, and several are controversial, among which is one against Eratosthenes.\n\nSir James Frazer considered him the most learned of all Greek antiquaries. \"His acquaintance both with the monuments and with the literature seems to have been extensive and profound. The attention which he bestowed on inscriptions earned for him the nickname of the 'monument-tapper.'\"\n\n The fragments of Polemon have been published by Preller in the work entitled Polemonis Periegetae Fragmenta, collegit, digessit, notis auxit L. Preller, Lips., 1838.\n\nPlease rewrite this description of Polemon of Athens to be more conversational and engaging.","chosen":"Hey there! I'm Polemon of Athens, but you can call me Polemon.

I've been all over Greece, visiting places and writing about them. I've also collected epigrams from the monuments and votive offerings I've seen.

He was a Stoic philosopher and geographer who lived during the 2nd century BC. He was well-known for his extensive travels throughout Greece, where he gathered information about the places he visited.\n\nWhat's truly remarkable about Polemon is his dedication to collecting epigrams. He gathered inscriptions from votive offerings and columns, which earned him the nickname Stelokopas. He compiled this collection into a work called \"On the inscriptions to be found in cities\". This work must have been incredible, as it may have been a primary source for the Garland of Meleager!\n\nSir James Frazer described Polemon as the most learned of all Greek antiquaries. His knowledge of both the monuments and literature was extensive and profound. He paid particular attention to inscriptions, which earned him the nickname of the \"monument-tapper\".\n\nDespite his many works and accomplishments, most of Polemon's writings are now lost to history.

{"prompt":"What are some important facts about the tuna fish species, for example their life cycle, diet and habitat, and any threats to their populations?","chosen":"Tuna are commercially valuable fish that are widely used in food products and are popular in the aquarium trade. Here are some key facts about tuna:\n\n- **Life cycle:** Tuna are long-lived and highly migratory species, which means they migrate over long distances during their lives. They can live up to 30 years and reach sexual maturity at around 5 years of age.\n- **Diet and habitat:** Tuna are carnivorous and feed on smaller fish, squid, and crustaceans. They are found in tropical and temperate oceans and prefer open water habitats, but some species also occur in coastal areas.\n- **Threats to populations:** Overfishing, bycatch in commercial fisheries, and habitat loss are all threats to tuna populations. Additionally, some species are vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear, which can lead to injury or death.\n\nSome species of tuna are listed as Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List, including the Yellowfin Tuna, Bigeye Tuna, and Southern Bluefin Tuna.","rejected":"Tuna are a diverse species of ray-finned fish that belong to the family Thunnidae. This family also includes albacore tuna, yellowfin tuna, skipjack tuna, and bigeye tuna. These fish are well-known for their incredible speed, with yellowfin tuna being able to swim at over 60 miles per hour. They are found in oceans around the world and are highly migratory, meaning they travel long distances across the ocean. Tuna have a lifespan of around 20 years, and during their lifetime they will travel thousands of miles across the ocean.\n\nTuna are carnivores, meaning they only eat other animals. They have a varied diet that includes other fish, squid, and crustaceans. They are also apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain and have no natural predators. This makes them an important part of the ocean's ecosystem, as they help to keep populations of other fish in check.\n\nTuna are highly valuable as a food source, and are commercially fished around the world. However, overfishing and bycatch have led to a decline in their populations in recent years. To help protect tuna populations, sustainable fishing practices must be implemented."}

{"prompt":"What are some interesting facts about twins?","chosen":"Identical twins are formed when a single sperm fertilizes a single egg, resulting in one zygote that splits into two. This results in genetically identical twins.\n\nFraternal twins, on the other hand, occur when a woman releases multiple eggs during ovulation, which are then fertilized by multiple sperm. This results in fraternal twins.\n\nThere are several studies on the genetics of twins, including the study by Ellis et al. (2007) that found a higher rate of identical twins in populations with a higher frequency of autosomal dominant conditions.\n\nThere are also studies on the environmental factors that contribute to the development of twins, such as the study by Gerton et al. (2005) that found a higher rate of twins in women who had undergone in vitro fertilization.\n\nThe rate of twins varies across different populations, with some populations having a higher rate of identical twins and others having a higher rate of fraternal twins.\n\nIdentical twins are often thought to have a special bond, and there are studies that support this idea, such as the study by Monk and colleagues (2007) that found identical twins to be more similar in personality traits than fraternal twins.\n\nThere are also studies on the differences between identical and fraternal twins, such as the study by Plomin and colleagues (2007) that found identical twins to be more similar in cognitive ability than fraternal twins.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many interesting facts about twins, including their formation, genetics, and environmental factors, as well as their unique bond and differences between identical and fraternal twins.","rejected":"I'm sorry, but I cannot answer your question without a reference text.

{"prompt":"What is the difference between a station wagon and a SUV?","chosen":"A station wagon and a SUV are both types of vehicles that are commonly used for family transportation, but they have some distinct differences.\n\nA station wagon is typically a longer, more streamlined car that is designed for cargo and passenger space. They often have a boot (trunk) at the back that is large enough to store luggage or other items, and some models have folding seats that can increase the available space. Station wagons are often used for long road trips or for families with children.\n\nOn the other hand, a SUV (sport utility vehicle) is a larger, more rugged vehicle that is designed for both on-road and off-road use. SUVs often have four-wheel drive and a higher ground clearance than other types of vehicles, making them more capable of handling rough terrain. SUVs are often used for outdoor activities such as camping or hunting, but they are also popular for family transportation due to their spacious interior and safety features.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between a station wagon and a SUV is their design and intended use.

It is a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body from harmful substances, such as bacteria, viruses, and toxins. The immune system is responsible for identifying foreign substances and destroying them before they can cause damage to the body.\n\nThe immune system works by producing specialized cells, called lymphocytes, which are capable of recognizing and destroying foreign substances. When a foreign substance is detected, the immune system releases antibodies, which are specialized proteins that can bind to the foreign substance and mark it for destruction by other immune cells. The immune system also has memory cells, which remember the specific foreign substance that was encountered and can quickly produce antibodies against it if it is encountered again in the future.\n\nThe immune system is a complex and dynamic system that requires constant monitoring and maintenance to ensure that it is functioning properly. When the immune system is not functioning properly, it can lead to a variety of diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues, and immunodeficiencies, where the immune system is not able to effectively protect the body from foreign substances."}

{"prompt":"What is the physics behind the phenomenon of echolocation used by bats to navigate in the dark?","chosen":"The physics behind echolocation used by bats to navigate in the dark is based on the principles of reflection and sound waves. When a bat emits an ultrasonic sound, it listens to the echoes that bounce back from objects in its environment. By analyzing the time it takes for the echo to return and the intensity of the echo, the bat can determine the size, shape, and distance of the object. This information is then used by the bat to navigate and locate prey in complete darkness.\n\nThis phenomenon is possible due to the high-frequency sound waves produced by the bats, which are beyond the range of human hearing. The sound waves are emitted as a series of short pulses, typically lasting less than a millisecond, and with a frequency of around 20 kHz to 100 kHz. These sound waves travel through the air and bounce off objects in the environment, returning to the bat as echoes.\n\nWhen the sound wave hits an object, it is partially absorbed and partially reflected. The reflected sound wave is then detected by the bat's ears, which are highly sensitive and can detect even the faintest echoes. The bat can then calculate the distance to the object by measuring the time it takes for the echo to return. The intensity of the echo also provides information about the size and shape of the object, as well as its surface texture.\n\nThe process of echolocation is highly sophisticated and allows bats to navigate and hunt in complete darkness, with an accuracy that rivals even the most advanced radar systems. It has been extensively studied by scientists and has led to many technological advancements, such as the development of sonar and echolocation devices used by the military and emergency responders.","rejected":"Echolocation is a phenomenon used by bats to navigate in the dark by emitting high-frequency sounds and analyzing the echoes that bounce back from objects in their environment. The bats' brains process the returning echoes to create a mental image of their surroundings, which they use to navigate and find prey.\n\nThe physical principles behind echolocation are the reflection and absorption of sound waves. When a bat emits a sound, it travels through the air and hits objects in its path. Some of the sound waves are reflected back to the bat, while others are absorbed by the objects. The bat's brain interprets the time delay and the intensity of the returning echoes to create a representation of the object's shape, size, and distance.\n\nEcholocation is an example of active sensing, where an organism generates and interprets its own sensory signals to perceive the world. This is in contrast to passive sensing, where an organism perceives environmental stimuli without actively producing them. Echolocation allows bats to navigate and hunt in complete darkness, and it has been the subject of extensive research in the fields of bioacoustics, neuroscience, and animal behavior."}
{"prompt":"What is the principle of operation of a hydraulic ram pump, and what are some potential applications for this device?","chosen":"A hydraulic ram pump is a device that uses the energy of falling water to pump water from one location to another. The principle of operation is based on the principle of a hydraulic ram, which uses the energy of falling water to lift water to a higher elevation. A hydraulic ram pump consists of a pipe that is attached to a water source, such as a river or stream, and a water receiver, such as a tank or reservoir. When water flows through the pipe, it creates a vacuum at the downstream end, which draws water from the river or stream into the pipe. The water then flows through a valve and into the water receiver, where it is stored for later use.\n\nHydraulic ram pumps have a number of potential applications, including:\n\n1. Providing water for irrigation in remote or rural areas where there is no access to electricity or other sources of power.\n2. Supporting communities that rely on traditional water sources, such as rivers and streams, for their drinking water needs.\n3. Supporting emergency response efforts in the aftermath of natural disasters, such as earthquakes or hurricanes, when traditional water sources may be contaminated or inaccessible.\n4. Supporting sustainable development efforts, as hydraulic ram pumps require no external power source and can be easily maintained and repaired by local communities.","rejected":"The hydraulic ram pump uses the energy from a flowing river or stream to move water from a lower to a higher elevation without the use of electricity. The pump's principle of operation is based on the principle of kinetic energy conversion.\n\nPotential applications for the hydraulic ram pump include irrigation, domestic water supply, and fire protection. The pump can be used to provide water for agriculture, livestock, and other uses. Additionally, it can be used to provide water for residential areas, especially in remote or off-grid locations where access to electricity is limited. The pump can also be used to provide water for fire protection in rural areas where traditional fire hydrants are not available."}

Barnes graduated from University of Wisconsin Law School in 2000.\n\nBackground \n\nBarnes was formerly a partner at the Bernhoft Law Firm. It was there that Barnes, along with owner and managing partner Robert G. Bernhoft, served as actor Wesley Snipes' criminal defense lawyer. In 2008, Snipes stood trial on federal charges of conspiracy to defraud the government and related counts. The jury acquitted Snipes of conspiracy and felony tax evasion but convicted him on three (out of six) counts of misdemeanor failure to file income tax returns. Judge William Terrell Hodges imposed the maximum sentence of three consecutive one-year terms, which Snipes served after an unsuccessful appeal.\n\nBarnes has also represented Ralph Nader regarding ballot access in his 2004 presidential bid, eight Covington High School students and Alex Jones in the civil lawsuit following Jones' covering of the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre. He was also hired for Kyle Rittenhouse's defense team following the 2020 Kenosha unrest shooting and as the attorney of plaintiff Dustin Hice in his sexual assault lawsuit against CNN anchor Don Lemon in 2021.\n\nIn 2019, Barnes began making weekly Sunday evening appearances on David Freiheit's YouTube channel, where the two discuss recent legal and political events. Barnes also co-hosts a weekly Monday afternoon show on YouTube called What Are The Odds? with pollster Richard Baris.\n###\nWrite a summary of the text for laypeople in at least 5 sentences.","chosen":"Robert Barnes is a criminal tax attorney and political commentator.
