{"domain": "askphysics_train", "prompt": "Are there any truly discontinuous processes in nature? Basically the title. Are there any processes that\u2019re actually instant or just extremely fast? One that comes to my mind are shocks in compressible flow but I\u2019m pretty sure there are people studying the dynamics of shocks so they aren\u2019t instantaneous. Thanks in advance!", "chosen": "In all likelihood, probably not. Usually when you see a discontinuous process in nature what you are really seeing is something that is changing on scales too small to be of much import to the problem. Such as if are thinking about a flash of lightning. On the time scales of minutes it\u2019s practically instantaneous, on the time scales of nanoseconds it\u2019s an eternity.", "rejected": "Physics is very much a world of models. When you model som process you assume something about the time scale it takes.  Just like you say, almost all models with some discontinuous function are just a way of saying \u201cthis changes much faster than any other scale in this problem so it\u2019s okay to treat it as a sudden change\u201d."}
{"domain": "askacademia_train", "prompt": "What to bring to an academic conference? I\u2019m a PhD student in the humanities getting ready to present at my first in person conference.   I\u2019ve attended and presented in virtual conferences before, but I don\u2019t know what to bring to this one when I\u2019m not attending from the comfort of my own home. Do I need business cards? Should I bring snacks/a water bottle?", "chosen": "Boiled sweets are a good, *silent* glucose boost between meal breaks.   Lip balm, a small tube of hand cream, pocket tissues, and ibuprofen can be life savers.", "rejected": "100% recommend business cards. I made some of my best science friends this way"}
{"domain": "askengineers_train", "prompt": "Whats a good way to learn engineering in your early years?", "chosen": "Lego.", "rejected": "Learn programming. Try CodeAcademy or something simpler like lightbot."}
{"domain": "askengineers_train", "prompt": "How long did it take you to get hired after graduating? I just graduated in May and I am currently struggling to find a job. I've applied to thousands of jobs and only gotten 3 responses back. My dad says to just be patient because he spent a few months looking for a job before he found one (he ended up joining the military). So how long did it take you to find a job after you had first graduated?", "chosen": "First and foremost, if you've done thousands of applications you've been doing it wrong.  I took a 5 minute pass over your resume. The main problem I am seeing is how cluttered with information it is.  Here is my opinion and crappy paint job on what I think you could do with it.  https://imgur.com/a/XYUh5xj", "rejected": "I didn\u2019t have to interview. I just showed up on Monday after graduating to the job I had as an intern. My position changed from Intern to Project Engineer. I worked the job part time while finishing up school as a full time student. This was 17 years ago. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s much harder now."}
{"domain": "askacademia_train", "prompt": "What type of cranks does your discipline attract? I'm in religious studies and just got an email from someone letting me know his bizarre theories about the Bible.", "chosen": "Condensed matter physics.  There's one very persistent guy emailing everybody and their mother about how the 2010 Nobel price in physics (for the discovery of graphene) was \"stolen\".  The strange thing is that the guy is very insistent, knows how to fake emails from reputable scientists/institutions, has access to a bot net in order to spam emails, and has the knowledge to effectively get past automated spam filters - yet his writing and grammar are so horrendous, I don't even understand what his argument is.  I think his pages and pages of incoherent rambling can be condensed to \"How come those guys got the Nobel for graphene, yet we haven't even used it for anything yet?? Where are the applications they promised??\".  It's very strange.", "rejected": "I'm in English literature and pretty much every department has its own token Deleuze & Guattari and/or Derrida enthusiast."}
{"domain": "askengineers_train", "prompt": "What are the best YouTube channels related to engineering?  What channels do you know such as \"engineering guy\", \"minute physics\", \"vsauce\"...?

We designed a theoretical self-sustainable solar powered water desalination system that was designed to be low tech and for residential usage. Our efficiency was 0.5% lmao.", "rejected": "I built a theremin. It was a fun project."}

{"domain": "askengineers_train", "prompt": "Recent grads/Seniors: How's the job search going? I realize this question has been asked numerous times, but I figured this answer could change year by year depending on the market. Also I'm just looking to vent. Have been mainly interviewing with huge corporations, 3 onsites so far - all rejected, 2nd round phone interview next week, and another onsite in few weeks. How's it going for the rest of you?", "chosen": "With how much google figures out what you're doing with your search patterns, I'm surprised it doesn't have the suicide prevention hotline posted at the top of the browser when it learns you're searching for a job.  Searching for a job is easily the most self-esteem crushing tasks I have ever had to do since I was born.  I graduated last May in Mechanical Engineering.  I want to be in Control Systems/Robotics so I've learned programming.  No one will give me the time of day, though, since I don't have an EE, Software Eng., or CS degree.  I'm currently networking; Chicago has a huge Python meetup group with a free mentorship program.  I am giving a speech in June on the project I'm currently working on, and I'm told some people have gotten job offers just from those talks.  Fingers crossed I have something before then, but until then the project is my main focus not only for the talk but also for something to slap on my resume.", "rejected": "Graduated in August with my masters and only started getting calls and interviews in January. I applied for at least 80 positions with Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Lockheed, Sierra Nevada, SpaceX, NASA, etc. All entry level positions, most not even requiring a masters. The thing in common with the positions I got interviews for is that I had referrals for those positions. Especially for your first job with a big company, you need some kind of in. Whether that \"in\" is a connection that can refer you or you were an intern for them, you need a way to set yourself apart internally within the company.  I'm in the final stages of getting a position and I only got the first interview because an alumni of my masters program got a hold of me and told me to apply so he could get the referral bonus. That's exactly how he got his first job with this company as well. It's a fucked up world out there right now trying to find your first job. Keep on the grind and network, network, network. I didn't want to believe how important it was because I wanted to \"do it all on my own\". Well, I tried that for over 8 months (applying before graduation) and it didn't get me anything. You need to work every angle and connection you have. There is no shame in asking someone for a referral. Worst they can say is no, and if they do you're still in the same unemployed position anyway."}
