{"domain": "askengineers_train", "prompt": "I am correct in understanding that it would be practically impossible to get a job if I had a 6-9 year gap after graduation? Would there be literally no options or would there even be a slight chance that I could get hired?", "chosen": "Jesus OP answer some of these questions so you can at least get a reasonable answer. You gave far to little detail.", "rejected": "As has been said, it comes down to why there is a gap. Without knowing the reason, no one can give you a decent answer other than \"If you give no reason on your resume for that gap, it will look very bad.\"  If you share that reason on here, you will probably get some useful information. Maybe even a way to spin it so that it looks good."}
{"domain": "askengineers_train", "prompt": "What kind of Engineer are you? For how long? What is your salary?", "chosen": "Mechanical/Manufacturing/Supply Chain with  ~15 years but really now operations leadership now all-in just broke $300k this year.", "rejected": "In case you're interested in some north of the border data, the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA) publishes a yearly salary survey. I think all the Canadian associations do. https://www.apega.ca/assets/PDFs/salary-survey-highlights.pdf  As an fyi, in order to practice as an Engineer in Canada, or use the title engineer, you must be a professional engineer with a association."}
{"domain": "askengineers_test", "prompt": "What is your opinion on sales engineering? I am an ME student and have the option of doing internships as a company representative or other roles in sales. I am neither a great speaker nor am I an extrovert. Should I take the internship? Is sales engineering better (money-wise) in the long run than technical roles?", "chosen": "Start technical for 2-5 years, then you can consider some of these other roles. This will open many doors.  If you don\u2019t gain technical experience first  1) You likely won\u2019t have a good feel for how products work and their limitations, what your customers care about, or their development process. I hate working with those sales engineers.  2) You\u2019ll have a really hard time getting a technical job later on, or any role that leans on past technical experience. This can be limiting from a career perspective", "rejected": "It's boring."}
{"domain": "askengineers_train", "prompt": "Engineer or Technician ? Why some people choose to be a technician? Why some people I know went to a specialised technician job although he has an engineering degree?  If you are this person, please give me your opinion.   Also, I want you guys to discuss the pros and cons. Please argue with each other, it will give more emotional reason.", "chosen": "Work for a small company and you get to be both.", "rejected": "I think I\u2019m about to go in that direction since I have been applying for a ME position for 3 years and cannot find anything around here."}
{"domain": "askengineers_train", "prompt": "Why are an engine's head and block mated (with a head gasket) right at the point combustion happens? If the engine block and head mated at a point further \"down\" towards the crankshaft, so the combustion area was entirely in the head and not in the block, wouldn't this negate the need for a head gasket?  Or are the benefits of this design outweighed by the effort it would take to hone out the cylinders if they were in a blind hole?", "chosen": "The most common types of small aircraft engines do not use a head gasket. See this cutaway (pdf) for a common example of a cylinder.", "rejected": "Oh, also, there have been engines with the block and head as one piece, but the benefits are far outweighed by the difficulty of machining the valve seats, among other things.   Head gaskets generally only fail if the engine is overheated or the design is inferior."}
{"domain": "askscience_train", "prompt": "What advantage does the eye's (or brain's) white-balance-like system give, and how does it work? So I have noticed that when I close my right eye for a while and keep my left eye open in broad daylight, I see warmer colours in my left eye and see cooler colours in my right eye when I open it. This is similar to the white balance in smartphone cameras.  But is there any evolutionary advantage to this? And how does it work?", "chosen": "Auto color balance lets you see things in all kinds of light conditions (dynamic range is something like a factor of a billion!) and perceive colors correctly despite variations in the color of the illumination.  The mechanism is fatigue in your retinal cells, which makes each cell\u2019s response self-adjust as fresh unexposed pigment gets regenerated in the eye.  In bright light not only does the total amount of pigment shrink, the rate of regeneration also shrinks.  There are other time dependent and spatially-dependent adjustment mechanisms but that is the dominant one.", "rejected": "Someone else could probably elaborate on this and explain it better, but as I understand this has to do with certain chemicals in your cones being used up before others, in particular red. When your eyes are closed, some light still comes through your eyelids, and the blood flowing through the capillaries lets through mostly red light. When your eye is then opened, the \"red\" chemicals are more depleted than green or blue, so those colors are more vivid because the signals from the green and blue cones on that eye's retina are stronger.

I wanted to actually ask how popular and useful are websites like ResearchGate and Academia, but just wondering what are some social websites you recommend every researcher should know. Thanks.", "chosen": "Crossref to search DOIs  https://www.crossref.org", "rejected": "I would tentatively suggest Litmaps.com. It's been a great service, but they've recently nerfed their free tier and dramatically increased the prices of the Pro ($480/year is a fucking joke, Litmaps, if you're listening)."}
{"domain": "askengineers_train", "prompt": "Being bored out of my head My friends in electrical engineering are always doing these fun projects at home with arduinos and what not. My friends in computer science are writing amazing, functional programs to kill time.  I as a mechanical engineering student have nothing I can do (at least that comes to mind). Every interesting project needs a lot of money. So help, can I as a mechanical engineering student kill time with fun, relevant projects? If so, like what?", "chosen": "I'm an actual mechanical engineer who uses solidworks. My friend, you need to get into modeling and printing. You can make all those contraptions you learned about like 4 bar members and various springy, fun parts like watch components out of plastic. If you use resin-wax printing you can even try to make moulds with lost-wax casting.   I like to make renders and for-fun models at home; most recently I made a resin rose with 10 thou thick pedals. You can make anything, so why not? Most schools have free 3d printing and solidworks licenses available, or you can get a student license for really cheap!", "rejected": "Make a rocket! You can go surprisingly far with just cardboard, plywood, and plastic.  If you want to do the bigger more fun ones, join NAR or TRA."}
{"domain": "askengineers_train", "prompt": "Something designed to fail? I am looking for examples of products where a component is designed to fail in some manner.  Ideally made of plastic.  A classic example is the retaining right on a bottle of soda that has to fracture in order to access the soda.  Can you think of others?  The more complex the better, but simple systems will work as well.  Not frangible items, or things built for planned obsolescence.", "chosen": "OP I'm about to blow your mind. Packaging. It's sole purpose is to hold an item until it is deemed worthy of opening, at which point it's purpose is to be destroyed.   Candy bars, bag o chips? Plastic wrappers with triangles cut along the edge? Failure zones, meant to be teared opened easily.   That super fucking durable plastic that houses common electrical components and tools? Made to be hard to open to prevent stealing. Ever take a pair of scissors and cut along it? Shit spreads wide open easily.  Packaging wrap or the common household name Saran wrap. It's sole existence is to be destroyed. Used everyday in manufacturing shipping and for your grandma's pork chops which will later be crumpled up and thrown in the trash.   Shifting gears. Contacts, the things people put in their eyes. Made to be consumed and thrown away. Cellulose, a life matter that is a polymer, used as a common fiber in foods to make you shit out all the bullshit you've been eating. Chewing gum, it's made to be chewed then discarded. There are millions of items that use plastics in our life that have a lifespan of exactly one time use.   -A polymer engineer", "rejected": "Electric Cars have pyro fuses that cuts all of the high voltage lines in event of a crash to prevent short circuits and potentially electrocuting you when trying to egress from the crash."}
{"domain": "askengineers_train", "prompt": "When I'm stopped facing uphill on an incline and I press the gas, the engine increases in RPM but doesn't quite move. If I don't ever move, where is that rotation in the engine manifesting itself?", "chosen": "Transmission slippage.  In clutch cars, the engine half, which is spinning rapidly, slips against the rear half, which doesn't move at all. If you do this, your mechanic will hate you. Clutches work by crushing two metal plates together and using the enormous friction present (even on polished-smooth faces) as a joining mechanism. If there's a difference in rotation speed between these two, they heat up **enormously**. Keeping the clutch at medium throws leaves the two plates close enough that they sort of act like a clutchless transmission (there is fluid in the clutch pumpkin, so the spinning engine plate spins the fluid which sort of spins the rear plate, but poorly), but this still creates an enormous amount of heat. You will destroy your car by doing this for prolonged periods of time.  In clutchless cars, the engine fan spins freely, torqueing the transmission fluid, which puts force on the rear fan. The rear fan is motionless as gravity-driven torque combats fluid-driven torque. Clutchless transmissions are just fine for doing this. The fluid heats up, but there's no contact friction between mechanical components.  In summary: the physicist's answer is that the rotation manifests partially as work against gravity and mostly as heat, and the mechanic's answer is that the rotation manifests as money flow from your wallet to his.", "rejected": "Heat by friction.  This is why you don't do this for too long, otherwise you cook the clutch. I used to live in an extremely hilly city, and every time someone had to maneuvre on its roads the smell of hot clutch could be felt in the entire neighborhood."}
