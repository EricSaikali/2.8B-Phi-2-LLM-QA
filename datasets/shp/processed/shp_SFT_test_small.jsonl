{"domain": "askscience_train", "prompt": "If soil comes from dead plants, what substrate did the first terrestrial plants grow on? This question was asked by my 8-year old as part of a long string of questions about evolution, but it was the first one where I didn't really know the answer. I said I'd look it up but most information appears to be about the expected types of plants rather than what they actually grew on.", "chosen": "primitive land plants were moss-like. mosses can grow on bare rock, getting their nutrients (like nitrogen) from rainwater  essentially, the easiest terrestrial environment for an aquatic organism is... a wet terrestrial environment  many modern mosses can also tolerate cycles of drying up, so they don't rely on soil for humidity, an some can fix nitrogen from the air via bacterial association, similarly to legumes and lichens", "rejected": "Rocks, sand, clay, volcanic ash, or floated around in water. Basically take your pick of natural substrate. Plants started as eukaryotes in the ocean and may have formed from cyanobacteria mats that float around in colonies. Lichens that are cyanobacteria and algae started to colonize land and afterwards a new type of vascular plant like Cooksonia evolved. The plants got more complex evolving seeds then gymnosperms and finally flower plants. They all grew on top of the decayed matter. Animals and plants evolved relatively along the same timeframe, but there is still scientific debate so some plants may have had fungal byproducts from decaying animal remains too."}

I'm a big believer in being \"well-rounded\".", "rejected": "I was (and am) a great artist and I loved creating and made money off of it and did competitions until I was 17.

{"domain": "askacademia_train", "prompt": "Do You think most of the research doesn\u2019t have and won\u2019t have a real world application?

While not all, there are many professors who publish completely useless or irrelevant research, and are awarded tenure, not because of the merit of the work, but because of the number of publications they have. While I could go on and on, what I feel like I saw in academia was a form of \"natural selection\" (if you will) where all of the ones who have the most useful or relevant research skills are either pushed out through some systemic or institutional limitation (as I was), or leave because they feel that research in academia will make little to no relevant contribution. Them leaving creates a \"brain drain\" where the ones who are willing to sell their souls for pittance, and the ones who genuinely want to be there, are left. They move up the ranks, artificially rewarded by a system they have little interest in changing or challenging, because it worked for them; while they hypocritically complain about wanting systemic change and wanting to revolutionize their clearly limited institutions. Meanwhile, the ones with all of the relevant skillsets have moved on to industry or government, where their skills have practical and influential application, and they are earning far more money and are overall more satisfied with their careers.   I only say this because I recently left an institution where everyone was screaming Black Lives Matter, but awarded tenure to a guy with a widely known racist history of behavior whose research focus was partly centered on how Black people are genetically predisposed to [insert negative attribute here]. Completely irrelevant to the liberation of Black people, Black bodies, and making no beneficial contribution to cultivating inclusion and diversity anywhere, or in any space; he was awarded tenure, simply because he published.", "rejected": "If science has you discouraged, you can always come join us in the humanities, where our research will determine the exact phrasing some poet ten people have ever heard of wrote in a letter to their fiance in 1847.

{"domain": "askengineers_train", "prompt": "Why do tractors seem to have so much longer service life vs other commercial vehicles? It\u2019s not uncommon to see farms using 30-50+ year old tractors, yet it is rare to see delivery trucks, pickup trucks, etc. this old still being used for commercial purposes? Why are tractors able to last so long when they are usually parked outside in the elements 24/7 and see pretty heavy use?", "chosen": "Background: Grew up on a vegetable farm (tractors are constantly moving) and went to school for Ag Engineering.  Speaking broadly: A tractors life is generally dictated by how many hours are on it. 10,000 hours seems to be the point at which, generally, it costs more to service and operate than just operate. If a tractor doesnt see any use, than it will generally linger around until it sees that many hours. It used to be far more common to see older tractors being fixed by the farmers themselves but two very important things have happened...  1. Farms got bigger and farmers themselves are more like businessman (CA at least). Why concern yourself with playing mechanic when your time makes more money worrying about other things? 2. John Deere makes the tractors somewhat difficult to fix yourself and they are known for jacking up the price for older tractor parts on certain versions of tractors.  tl;dr depends on the size of the farm and how many hours are put on it each year. They are (supposed to be anyway) designed for the elements though I would argue that is not the case anymore.", "rejected": "I don't design tractors, but I think one of the reasons coild be that tractors may be designed to withstand unlimited fatigue cycles and of course to be much more resistant to harsh weather conditions, while other vehicles are designed to have a limited fatigue life."}

{"domain": "askengineers_train", "prompt": "If 100% of cars were EVs, do we have enough power on the grid to charge them all at once? How much extra capacity would we require, if everyone was to come home at 6pm and all simultaneously plug in their chargers? assuming no Batteries (Tesla Powerwall's etc) are used to provide this power.", "chosen": "Some of these responses don\u2019t seem to be from engineers.", "rejected": "Realistically, if we as a society get to the point where a majority of cars are all electrics, there will have to be some form of grid-car communication to prevent overloading of the system during this exact situation.  Our grid currently has the capacity, just not all at the same time.  For instance, midnight to 6am, the grid has a pretty low demand.  We could totally have most cars to wait until then to charge (with some kind of override button to begin charging immediately).  I read several different articles recently that had proposed this exact same solution for a more renewable grid. Renewables are not as on-demand as our current grid, so we would need some kind of large battery storage (like every car plugged in at the same time) to combat that.  Though that is more for drawing power from the cars in times of high demand, and charging them up when there's extra supply."}
{"domain": "askacademia_train", "prompt": "If you had a kid in grad school, what was it like? I am a female entering my second year of a life sciences PhD and I want to have a biological child.   Anybody who has gone through this, can you share what it was like? How you feel it affected your PhD/relationships/career? What you wish you would have known or done, or what you're glad you knew or did? How the timing of kid(s) corresponded with and affected your PhD? Anything else that I'm not even thinking to ask?  Thank you in advance!!", "chosen": "Small (about 7 lbs), really short, disproportionately large head. Couldn't really do much for years.", "rejected": "I had a child halfway through my PhD (while my husband was midway through a 4 year federal postdoc). I had already finished all of my coursework, field work, and lab work, and passed my comps, so I was ABD. We knew from observing many young faculty and friends in academia that our lives would never have the same level of flexibility again, so we decided to go for it before entering the TT job market. I stayed home with my child while working on my dissertation, which was sometimes pretty challenging but ultimately very much worth it. Luckily, it did not have a negative impact on my relationship with my advisor, who was very supportive and willing to accommodate my needs. It added about a year to my timeline, and I had to pay for tuition for those 2 extra semesters, but it was not very much since I only had to be registered for 3 hours each semester. I defended when my child was 18 months old. The end stretch was very difficult -- lots of very late nights, working on final data analyses and dissertation revisions into the wee hours of the morning while my kid was asleep. It was pretty exhausting and stressful for a few weeks, but...then it was over and I survived. Looking back, I fully believe we made the right decision, because if we had a baby right now (both at an R1, one as TT STEM faculty, one in high level research admin), we would be drowning. We see other early career faculty who have new babies or very young children, and most of them are struggling. Our child was 3 years old when we started at our university, so it was a bit easier to handle than taking on such a massive new job with a newborn."}
{"domain": "askscience_train", "prompt": "How do we know that life started 3.8 billion years ago? Life here being defined as any group of molecules being able to reproduce and maintain an atmosphere different from its environment.", "chosen": "There are two things to figure out: what is the sign of life, and when was the sign created.  When is pretty easy: we use isotopes of radioactive uranium as a \u201cclock\u201d: by comparing the number of different radioactive atoms remaining in a sample of rock, we can deduce how long the uranium has been trapped inside and so how old the rock is.  The \u201cwhat\u201d is trickier, and your 3.8 billion number is only a rough marker.  We have found unambiguous fossils of individual microbes from 3.45 billion years ago, and structures that look like mats of bacteria created 3.7 billion years ago.  Before that, we can\u2019t see any physical remains, but we can identify chemical traces of life.  These include the remains of complex organic molecules, or changes in the ratio of different isotopes of carbon.  These signatures go back to 3.8 billion years or earlier.  There are some very recent papers claiming the presence of fossils in rocks as old as 4.3 billion years ago, but these are controversial.  If true, since the Earth is 4.5 billion years old, they mean life evolved pretty much instantly once water could exist on the surface.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earliest_known_life_forms", "rejected": "We don't. We know there is evidence of life that early, but it could be earlier. But the geological record is incomplete; few rocks are preserved from those ages, and fossilisation is rare. So it's entirely possible life appeared earlier, we just don't have the evidence. Yet. Even if we do find evidence of earlier life, the odds of us fi ding the very earliest forms are miniscule to non existent.
