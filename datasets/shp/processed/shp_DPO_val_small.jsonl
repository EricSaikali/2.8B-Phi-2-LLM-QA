I've been lifting all of college, would such a lifestyle still be possible during my Ph.D.? I'd spend about 1 hour and 30 minutes at the gym 4-5 times a week (still do). Do any of you guys lift on the regular while still finishing your responsabilities?   &#x200B;  I love fitness and its a big part of my life.   &#x200B;  Thank you.", "chosen": "I don't work out as intensely as you (1 hour 2/3 times a week) but the thing is, if you feel like your schedule is packed and have no time, take one week and note down what you are doing with time stamps and most likely you will find an activity you can sacrifice. For me, I had to scratch that 1 hour of browsing memes each night I came back from uni, now I browse them only for 20 minutes on my way to and from the gym.", "rejected": "Your schedule will vary depending on the lab you join. Even if you don't work out, you should try to figure out what it will be before you join the lab. It's okay to ask other students in the lab how much they work."}

I actually did quite well and managed to get a first class degree. I have never been greatly confident with maths, during my undergrad I just about passed most of the maths classes with the other modules bumping up my grade and allowing me to graduate with a good grade. I am worried I will struggle to do some of the maths required off the top of my head in industry.", "chosen": "You can go into another field and manage people/processes. Bosses love to say they have an engineer on the team even if they are not in an engineering position.", "rejected": "I have a Master's in ME and I haven't had to use anything more than integer arithmetic or very basic algebra in at least a decade. If a company is making you do really intense calculations without a computer doing most/all of the heavy lifting for you **and** having another engineer check it, *they're* the ones screwing up."}

{"domain": "askacademia_train", "prompt": "Academics of Reddit, what was the most influential paper in motivating your thesis? There are probably of course a ton of papers that ended up being a motivation, but if you had to choose a single one, which one would it be?", "chosen": "I'm only just starting my PhD.

German)   It also has its own German Wiki page (Google transl version)", "rejected": "I'm going to take obscure pretty literally here. D.A. Miller's \"the Long Wrong Man\" is about how the Hitchcock cameo most people know of in the Wrong Man possibly isn't actually Hitchcock and instead he peaks out from behind an extra in the court room scene, almost entirely hidden save for his bald head and eyes (and of course, abruptly disappears or is replaced the next time the movie returns to the shot)."}
{"domain": "askengineers_train", "prompt": "Women engineers of Reddit: have you ever felt harassed in the workplace? I'm researching for a feature on harassment (sexual or otherwise) of women engineers in their places of work.   Have you had any experiences that you would deem as harassment? If so, what happened? Any comment is welcome.", "chosen": "Yes. When I had just started working an older field tech took me to a site I was unfamiliar with (to do routine sampling and testing). This guy was awful:  - hitting on me in the car while driving, instead of looking at the road he kept looking at me. I asked him to watch the road and he said \"why would I do that when I have something much better to look at\".  - when I quietly corrected him on how he was carrying out a field test he flipped out at me, yelling in front of the clients. I brought him outside to 'discuss' the matter and it took me calling our boss who confirmed to him I was correct before he'd agree to do the test correctly - sent dirty texts to another female colleague in the middle of the night - wrote me a creepy and weird poem for Christmas  A different job site: the site manager kept asking me out, and being generally flirty and inappropriate on the job. He ignored my advice and concerns as an engineer, and belittled me to the crew.  After 10 yrs in the field, most of the men I've worked with have been great, but these shitty experiences have definitely stood out. Thankfully my later work was for a company that took this sort of thing seriously, and haven't encountered it in the last few years whether from colleagues or clients. The worst in recent times has just been building crews asking me to bring them cakes. I just tell them to bake them themselves.", "rejected": "Never sexual harassment, but defiantly more discriminated or dismissed for being a woman. I deal with the steel industry, which seems to still be a little old school...it\u2019s pretty rare for me to see another woman on the floor (I am mostly in the mill on the job site rather than the offices). I find I\u2019m more dismissed by my own company rather than our customers. Recently my boss and I met to goal review and he asked where I wanted to be in five years. Being a 30 year old, single and childless female, he kept bringing up that I may eventually find the right man and want to lower my work schedule or change jobs due to kids. I told him nope, even if I have kids I like my job. I travel a lot, I\u2019m an applications engineer, so having a family would be tough, but I know with the right dude it\u2019s plausible. My career means everything to me, but it blows that having a family comes into to question with my career path but not with my coworkers.  I\u2019ve also been told I can\u2019t handle certain accounts due to locations. However that\u2019s a mixed bag of feelings. On one hand, I don\u2019t want to go there but on the other I\u2019m peeved because I was told I couldn\u2019t only because I have a vagina. My boss always puts it as, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want my daughter to go there/do that, so you aren\u2019t allowed to\u201d. I do also find that I am underestimated quite a bit. I know I have it far better than a lot of women out in the industrial world."}
{"domain": "askengineers_train", "prompt": "How can a Milwaukee handheld drill make 750 ft-lb of torque when most cars don\u2019t even make 300?", "chosen": "Most drills are in in-lbs. Not ft-lbs. So the drill is likely making 750in-lb = 62 ft-lb.   That being said, impact drivers can make significantly more torque because they only make it for a fraction of a second using a repeating hammer-mechanism.  That thud-thud-thud sound coming from the impact driver as it is torqueing in the bolt is a little hammer mechanism that can apply that very-high torque for a very small time, and if you repeat it enough times, the bolt will eventually reach that torque.  For instance the Dewalt 20V XR 1/2\" impact makes 300ft-lbs in the hammering method mentioned before, and although I've only ever tested it up to the 100ft-lb range it removed that bolt almost instantly, so I have no problem believing it'll do much higher than that.", "rejected": "Cars make 300Nm at the flywheel. Remember you have a 4:1 final drive ratio in the differential and another 3:1 for first gear so 12:1 between flywheel and wheels, so in first gear the wheels will experience 300x12=3600Nm.  It's easy to make tons of torque just by gearing something down. In fact torque values for engines are practically meaningless because torque is a curve, not just a single value, and can be manipulated by selecting an appropriate gear ratio. Power on the other hand is torque X rpm so tells you exactly how much of either of them you can get out of something. You'll find that a drill has about 1,000 watts but a car engine has more like 100,000 watts (1bhp = 750 watts approx.)"}
{"domain": "askacademia_train", "prompt": "What's your favorite aspect of academia? Least favorite?", "chosen": "Academia is amazing at aggregating bright people who deeply care about a topic.  But holy hell the politics and the bureaucracy that surrounds them.", "rejected": "The service is my least favorites. Most academics got into it for either the teaching or research (or both), but some don't know that there is a service component to it too. Things such as, attending graduation ceremonies, promotional events for the university, things of that nature. Some things are fun though, like advising student competition/chapters. I sat through my first graduation as an academic and it was pretty boring not knowing anyone or not receiving anything. I was actually looking forward to it, because at my Ph.D. institution the invited faculty went on stage for the respective departments and shook hands with the students as they passed. At my academic institution I literally walked in, sat there, and walked out. Service is only like 10% of the job though."}
{"domain": "askengineers_train", "prompt": "Do you find yourself challenged most of the time on your job as an engineer? I hope the title makes sense.  I\u2019m not working as an engineer but my job is not stimulating me enough mentally. I feel like I have more in the tank. Obviously this is a case by case scenario. Curious for some responses though.   Let me know if you\u2019re in the technical field or management side of things", "chosen": "nope", "rejected": "I\u2019d say I am more management than technical. Although I use both to a small degree.   Currently my biggest headaches is contracts.

{"domain": "askscience_train", "prompt": "What would happen to a sealed tin can in space? Would it explode? Is the metal strong enough to resist the pressure differential? Does it depend on the temperature? What if it were filled with water vs air at 1 atmosphere pressure?", "chosen": "Nothing. The difference is so small. Even when you increase the pressure in a soda bottle by several times, it will not explode. You can do that by blowing air into an empty soda bottle while underwater at 20 meters, 30 meters, closing it, and then opening it after ascent.", "rejected": "Water does not compress, so nothing would happen.  The water doesn't expand when the pressure is released.  If the can was filled with gas and it failed it would explode.  Scuba tanks are tested by filling them with water and pressurizing it to above the working pressure with a hydraulic ram.  If the tank fails the water just runs out.  If you did that with air there would be a big explosion.  Exploding scuba tanks have destroyed cars and small boats."}
