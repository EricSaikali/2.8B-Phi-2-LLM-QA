'e ) 2 sqrt ( 65 )']","answer":"E","answer_text":"base of triangle is 20 and area is 80 therefore height = 2 * 80 \/ 20 = 8 . now one side of triangle is of 10 . so we can get the point were the base is divided by applying pythagoras therm so division pt = sqrt ( 10 ^ 2 - 8 ^ 2 ) = sqrt ( 36 ) = 6 threfore other half is 14 . now second side = sqrt ( 14 ^ 2 + 8 ^ 2 ) = sqrt ( 260 ) = 2 sqrt ( 65 ) answer : E. Here is the formula sqrt(add(power(divide(multiply(80, const_2), 20), const_2), power(subtract(20, sqrt(subtract(power(10, const_2), power(divide(multiply(80, const_2), 20), const_2)))), const_2)))"}
