The question tells you that the G allele, which is for having a graying coat, is dominant over the g allele, which is for not having a graying coat.\nHaving a graying coat is the dominant allele's version of the coat graying trait. A horse with the dominant version of the coat graying trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat graying gene. So, offspring that have coat graying must have the genotype GG or Gg.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype GG or Gg.\nNot having a graying coat is the recessive allele's version of the coat graying trait. A horse with the recessive version of the coat graying trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat graying gene. So, offspring that do not have coat graying must have the genotype gg.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring that have coat graying to offspring that do not have coat graying is 4:0.

Choose the most likely ratio.\n\nOptions:\nA. 2:2\nB. 4:0\nC. 0:4\nD. 1:3\nE. 3:1","answer":"C","answer_text":"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have thorns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the thorns trait. The question tells you that the R allele, which is for having thorns, is dominant over the r allele, which is for not having thorns.\nHaving thorns is the dominant allele's version of the thorns trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the thorns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the thorns gene. So, offspring that have thorns must have the genotype RR or Rr.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype RR or Rr.\nNot having thorns is the recessive allele's version of the thorns trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the thorns trait must have only recessive alleles for the thorns gene. So, offspring that do not have thorns must have the genotype rr.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype rr.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring that have thorns to offspring that do not have thorns is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring that have thorns. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring that do not have thorns."}

The question tells you that the R allele, which is for having thorns, is dominant over the r allele, which is for not having thorns.\nHaving thorns is the dominant allele's version of the thorns trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the thorns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the thorns gene. So, offspring that have thorns must have the genotype RR or Rr.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype RR or Rr.\nNot having thorns is the recessive allele's version of the thorns trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the thorns trait must have only recessive alleles for the thorns gene. So, offspring that do not have thorns must have the genotype rr.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype rr.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring that have thorns to offspring that do not have thorns is 0:4.

The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a gray body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a black body.\nA black body is the recessive allele's version of the body color trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the body color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body color gene. So, offspring with a black body must have the genotype bb.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.\nA gray body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene. So, offspring with a gray body must have the genotype BB or Bb.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a black body to offspring with a gray body is 0:4.

Choose the most likely ratio.\n\nOptions:\nA. 3:1\nB. 4:0\nC. 2:2\nD. 0:4\nE. 1:3","answer":"B","answer_text":"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a hairy body or a hairless body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body hair trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a hairy body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a hairless body.\nA hairy body is the dominant allele's version of the body hair trait. A deer mouse with the dominant version of the body hair trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body hair gene. So, offspring with a hairy body must have the genotype BB or Bb.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.\nA hairless body is the recessive allele's version of the body hair trait. A deer mouse with the recessive version of the body hair trait must have only recessive alleles for the body hair gene. So, offspring with a hairless body must have the genotype bb.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a hairy body to offspring with a hairless body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a hairy body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairless body."}

Choose the most likely ratio.\n\nOptions:\nA. 3:1\nB. 1:3\nC. 0:4\nD. 2:2\nE. 4:0","answer":"E","answer_text":"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a hairy body or a hairless body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body hair trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a hairless body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a hairy body.\nA hairy body is the dominant allele's version of the body hair trait. A deer mouse with the dominant version of the body hair trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body hair gene. So, offspring with a hairy body must have the genotype BB or Bb.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.\nA hairless body is the recessive allele's version of the body hair trait. A deer mouse with the recessive version of the body hair trait must have only recessive alleles for the body hair gene. So, offspring with a hairless body must have the genotype bb.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a hairy body to offspring with a hairless body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a hairy body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairless body."}

Choose the most likely ratio.\n\nOptions:\nA. 0:4\nB. 3:1\nC. 4:0\nD. 1:3\nE. 2:2","answer":"C","answer_text":"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have horns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the horns trait. The question tells you that the H allele, which is for not having horns, is dominant over the h allele, which is for having horns.\nNot having horns is the dominant allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the dominant version of the horns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the horns gene. So, offspring that do not have horns must have the genotype HH or Hh.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype HH or Hh.\nHaving horns is the recessive allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the recessive version of the horns trait must have only recessive alleles for the horns gene. So, offspring that have horns must have the genotype hh.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring that do not have horns to offspring that have horns is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring that do not have horns. This cross is expected to never produce offspring that have horns."}

Use this information to determine why this behavior can increase the reproductive success of a male Amazonian poison frog.\nChoice \"Amazonian poison frogs live in tropical forests in northern South America. After a male and female frog mate, the female frog lays eggs on a plant. When tadpoles hatch from the eggs, the male frog lets the tadpoles climb onto his back. The male then searches for water trapped in the spaces where plants' leaves meet their stems. He puts his tadpoles in these small pools of water.\" is correct.\nChoice \"If the male frog puts a tadpole into a pool with a larger tadpole, the smaller tadpole is often eaten.

So, by putting each tadpole in its own pool of water, the male frog decreases the chances that the tadpoles will be eaten.

The question tells you that the m allele, which is for not having myotonia congenita, is recessive to the M allele, which is for having myotonia congenita.\nHaving myotonia congenita is the dominant allele's version of the myotonia congenita trait. A goat with the dominant version of the myotonia congenita trait must have at least one dominant allele for the myotonia congenita gene. So, offspring that have myotonia congenita must have the genotype MM or Mm.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype MM or Mm. These boxes are highlighted below.\nNot having myotonia congenita is the recessive allele's version of the myotonia congenita trait.

Choose the most likely ratio.\n\nOptions:\nA. 2:2\nB. 0:4\nC. 3:1\nD. 1:3\nE. 4:0","answer":"E","answer_text":"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with straight fur or curly fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fur type trait. The question tells you that the f allele, which is for curly fur, is recessive to the F allele, which is for straight fur.\nStraight fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur type trait. A cat with the dominant version of the fur type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fur type gene. So, offspring with straight fur must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.\nCurly fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur type trait. A cat with the recessive version of the fur type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fur type gene. So, offspring with curly fur must have the genotype ff.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with straight fur to offspring with curly fur is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with straight fur. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with curly fur."}
