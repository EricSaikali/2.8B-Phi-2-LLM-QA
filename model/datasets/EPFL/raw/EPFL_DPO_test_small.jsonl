The retweet network is a directed graph, where nodes are users and an edge going out from a user A and to a user B means that \"User A retweeted User B\". Which one is false about a Twitter bot that retweeted other users frequently but got never retweeted by other users or by itself?\n\nOptions:\nA. It will have a non-zero hub value\nB. It will have an authority value of zero\nC. It will have a PageRank of zero\nD. Its authority value will be equal to the hub value of a user who never retweets other users","chosen":"\nFirst, let's understand the concepts of hub and authority values in the HITS algorithm. \n\nIn the HITS algorithm, a hub value represents the importance of a user in terms of how many other users they retweet, while an authority value represents the importance of a user in terms of how many other users retweet them.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA: It will have a non-zero hub value - This is true because the bot retweeted other users frequently.\n\nB: It will have an authority value of zero - This is true because the bot never got retweeted by other users.\n\nC: It will have a PageRank of zero - This is false because the bot is actively retweeting other users, so it will have a non-zero PageRank value.\n\nD: Its authority value will be equal to the hub value of a user who never retweets other users - This is false because the bot is not getting retweeted by other users, so its authority value will be zero.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is D: Its authority value will be equal to the hub value of a user who never retweets other users.","rejected":"The correct answer is B: It will have an authority value of zero.\n\nExplanation:\nIn the HITS algorithm, authority value represents the quality and relevance of a user's content, while hub value represents the user's ability to find and amplify relevant content. If a Twitter bot frequently retweets other users but never gets retweeted itself, it means that it doesn't produce original or relevant content, thus its authority value should be low or close to zero. Therefore, option B is false. \n\nOption A is true because even though the bot is not getting retweeted, it is still amplifying others' content, so it will have a non-zero hub value. Option C is true as well because if the bot is not getting retweeted, its PageRank will be low or zero. Option D is also true because a user who never retweets others will have both authority and hub value of zero."}

Let $x^*$ have $k$ non-zero entries indexed by $I$, and extract these columns to form a submatrix $A_I$ of $A$, which is an $m \\times k$ matrix.\n\nNext, we analyze the linear dependency of the columns in $A_I$. If these columns are linearly dependent, there exists a non-trivial vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^k$ such that $A_I y = 0$. Using $y$, we construct two vectors $x^+$ and $x^-$ by adding and subtracting a small scalar $\\epsilon$ times $y$ from $x^*$, respectively, while ensuring the entries of $x^+$ and $x^-$ remain non-negative. Both $x^+$ and $x^-$ will still satisfy the equation $Ax = b$ since $A_I y = 0$ leads to $Ax^+ = Ax^- = Ax^* = b$.\n\nIf $x^*$ could indeed be represented as a convex combination of $x^+$ and $x^-$, this would contradict the premise that $x^*$ is an extreme point, unless $y = 0$ (the trivial solution indicating linear independence). Thus, for $x^*$ to be an extreme point, the columns of $A_I$ must be linearly independent, which is only guaranteed if $k \\leq m$ because a set of more than $m$ vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^m$ would necessarily be linearly dependent.\n\nTherefore, any extreme point $x^*$ of this linear program must have at most $m$ non-zero entries.
