Despite their best efforts, they could not figure out what was causing the problem. The odds seemed stacked against them, but they were determined to find a solution.\n\nDetermined to find a solution, the scientist began to troubleshoot the instrument. They checked the alignment of the optics, calibrated the detector, and verified the accuracy of the wavelength solution. However, their efforts were in vain. The readings still did not make sense.\n\nThe scientist then decided to take a closer look at the data. They plotted the spectral lines and compared them to known standards. They noticed that some of the lines were too narrow or too broad, indicating that the instrument was not resolving the fine structure of the lines.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the scientist decided to use a more powerful spectrograph. They borrowed one from a colleague and compared the data from the two instruments. The results were striking. The new spectrograph resolved the fine structure of the spectral lines, and the elemental composition of the star was revealed.\n\nThe scientist was thrilled with their success. They had overcome a seemingly insurmountable obstacle and achieved their goal. They knew that their work would have far-reaching implications for the field of astronomy and would help to advance our understanding of the universe.", "rejected": "This is an interesting topic, and I'd be happy to assist you in writing a story about it.
