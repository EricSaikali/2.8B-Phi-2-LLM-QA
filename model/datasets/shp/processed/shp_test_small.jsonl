{"domain":"askengineers_train","prompt":"How would the demolition of a skyscraper in a densely populated area like new york city take place?","chosen":"The tear it apart from the top down, and send all the debris down chutes or via cranes.  This can even be done with temporary roofing so the deomlition isn\u2019t visible, dust doesn\u2019t get everywhere, and it protects against falling debris","rejected":"Check out the demolition of 270 Park Ave. I just googled and picked one but there are lots of articles about it.   https:\/\/www.constructiondive.com\/news\/jpmorgan-chases-nyc-hq-demo-to-be-worlds-tallest\/546931\/#:~:text=The%20New%20York%20City%20Department,demolition%2C%20according%20to%20City%20Realty."}
{"domain":"askengineers_train","prompt":"When you run into a problem at work, what sources do you turn to when nobody else at the workplace knows what do to either? Do you turn to the internet? Try to find a vendor to do it? Ask a consultant? I am trying to be more efficient in finding very obscure answers to some stuff that comes up in the facility, and am curious what others out there do.","chosen":"1) check internet  2) check textbooks  I have had dealings with a  few consultants, as a tribe they rarely impress.","rejected":"My first stop for ideas is to scour the internet to see if I can find some good leads. I'll try internal resources as well, but if you're still lost it can be helpful to reach out to vendors that may have experience in the space your problem may be common in. If you're still SOL then a consultant could be the next stop to venture down if the problem is significant enough to warrant it."}
{"domain":"askacademia_train","prompt":"For Ph.D. students that used to work out consistently during college. Is it possible to do it during a Ph.D.? I'll be starting my Ph.D. this Fall. I've been lifting all of college, would such a lifestyle still be possible during my Ph.D.? I'd spend about 1 hour and 30 minutes at the gym 4-5 times a week (still do). Do any of you guys lift on the regular while still finishing your responsabilities?   &#x200B;  I love fitness and its a big part of my life.   &#x200B;  Thank you.","chosen":"I\u2019m a cycling captain here and a second year PhD student.  Yes it can be done, but you will have a lot less free time. Don\u2019t take time out of your PhD for your sport. Accept you won\u2019t be able to do everything and that you might have to catch up.   I find I have better time management than most of my lab mates but a few times I\u2019ve had to not go cycling due to deadlines","rejected":"Absolutely. I did an Ironman triathlon a few months before defending my proposal. ...you just won\u2019t have much of a social life depending on how much working out you plan to do."}
{"domain":"askengineers_train","prompt":"\u201cThe Incredible Machine\u201d is a classic game. What engineering\/puzzle games have you enjoyed? Booting up Sierra\u2019s \u201cThe Incredible Machine\u201d as a kid in 1995 is definitely one of the reasons I\u2019m pursuing this field today. For those unfamiliar with the game, it\u2019s based on constructing varying series\u2019 of Rube Goldberg machines to complete levels.   Revisiting those memories this morning got me thinking...What are some of the puzzle\/engineering games you\u2019ve enjoyed over the years?","chosen":"I'm not sure if it even still exists anymore but Fantastic Contraction anyone?  I'm mostly sure that name is correct.  Mainly powered and unpowered wheels with joints and you had to get a ball or balls to a goal area.  The fun part was most level could be solved in drastically different ways.  You don't like building a vehicle to carry the ball?  Ok, then build a catapult instead!  I'd love to have that game on Android!  I'm currently working my way through Poly Bridge 2.  It's a good balance of fun and frustrating, lol","rejected":"Man I'd forgotten all about that game, strange too considering how many hours I spent playing it. I've always liked any game that involves decent physics, once you have that engineering sort of comes along with it. Not so big on puzzle games though more open sandbox type games. Starbase, Space Engineers, Stationers, Astroneers and those similar to them."}
{"domain":"askengineers_train","prompt":"What calculator do you use?","chosen":"wolfram alpha","rejected":"The wolframalpha site. Really good for unit conversions where you can just type out what you want to do instead of selecting from dropdowns."}
{"domain":"askengineers_train","prompt":"What made you decide to become an engineer? And when did you make this decision?","chosen":"After my 11th birthday came and went with no Hogwarts acceptance letter... I figured RF engineering is the next closest thing to black magic.","rejected":"Like one of the other responders, I was good at math, science, and (believe it or not) art in high school.  My guidance counselor suggested architecture, but it didn't seem to fit.  So then I decided my two options were accounting and engineering (I had several friends who were engineering majors), and decided to go into civil engineering after day 1 of my first accounting class.  I picked civil engineering because I wanted to learn how to keep things standing, and I felt it would challenge me enough to feel like I earned my degree (and now paycheck).  I focused in structural engineering for my BS then got my MS in structural as well."}
{"domain":"askacademia_train","prompt":"For those of you who didn't end up in academia after your PhD, do you think your PhD experience was still worth it? Not just career-wise, but overall as a life experience?","chosen":"I'm two years out of an English PhD. Since then I've worked in market intelligence research (1.5 years) and currently I work for a policy institute doing research and communications. My current position is funded by a postdoc, but at this point I've left my original field entirely and there's no chance I'll ever be a professor. I love policy and hope to stay in this field.  Career wise, there are definitely more direct paths I could have taken to end up in my current field (a masters in economics or public policy), but this career path didn't even cross my radar until late in the PhD, and only because I was paying attention to where other grad students were getting jobs.  As a life experience, the PhD was definitely worth it for me! The experience of moving to a new city by myself (I did my undergrad and master's relatively close to home) was something I needed at the time, even though I'm back in my home town now. Now that COVID has us grounded for the foreseeable future, I'm soooo glad I used the opportunity to travel a bunch during my PhD. My school had really generous conference funding, so I was able to leverage that into some longer trips. As an English PhD, I had no lab commitments, and I had a fsirly distant relationship with my adviser, so once I finished coursework I'd just skip town for months at a time without telling anybody lol. I still finished the PhD in four years despite spending a cumulative 5-6 months backpacking overseas during that time! I think the travelling actually kept me motivated to be more productive when I was home. My dissertation topic was really fun. There were definitely challenging points early in the research process, but once I got going with the writing I was able to keep up the momentum. I only published one article based on the diss but it's gotten a decent amount of engagement and I'm happy with that.  Overall, I'm glad I did the PhD, but I think a big part of it was the timing. I finished at 28 and I'm a bit immature for my age so it just felt like I was continuing to \"self-discovery\" phase you're expected to have during undergrad.","rejected":"Lol, reading this only a month away from starting my PhD is a little demoralising...."}
{"domain":"askengineers_train","prompt":"Can flatlands that will soon be below sea level, like Bengal or Florida, be saved by large-scale diking in the way that the Netherlands and Belgium were? Honest, literal question. Can we dike our way out of the worst effects of rising sea levels?","chosen":"We could. Could we afford it? Probably not.  (The answer to many engineering questions is yes we can do that, but how will you pay for it)  New Orleans is 6 to 20 feet below sea level. So we have done it already.","rejected":"Can we..... sure probably.  It would be a massive undertaking unseen in the history of mankind.  It would require moving a States worth of stone, gravel, and dirt to build the foundation and then as much again to build the dike.  We would completely destroy the ecosystem as all of the typical water and animal movement would be slowed or stopped completely.  And massive pumps would need to constantly run to drain the bathtub created from the constant weeping of saltwater into it.    We shouldn't, for Florida especially.  Its more feasible for Manhattan Island and other densely populated cities where the perimeter is much much smaller.  I guess we will find out in 10 years."}
{"domain":"askengineers_train","prompt":"Why do piping come with tolerances instead of exact sizes ? I\u2019m ordering some piping and I notice the manufacturers usually have a +-10% tolerance   Why can\u2019t they guarantee me a certain diameter and thickness ?","chosen":"Would you prefer them to throw every pipe on a lathe? Guess what, you\u2019ll still get a tolerance range of +\\\\-0.005 and your cost will go up 25x.  Edit: if you need exact because you\u2019re doing something unconventional with the pipe, make a drawing and order it from a machine shop.","rejected":"You can pay for it\u2026but expect it to pay a stupid amount for it.  Tolerances allows mass production of parts at reasonable costs.  Tighter tolerances often result in higher costs.  Those tolerances are typically standard and you can trace it back to the associated standards.  I will turn the question back on you\u2026Why do you need the pipe to be a certain diameter and wall thickness?  Is the system so sensitive that it can not handle that tolerance?  I have seen research systems require very tight tolerances but often they focus on orifices and not the pipe itself.  You should have enough of a safety factor in your design to handle standard tolerances."}
{"domain":"askacademia_train","prompt":"What are the pros about getting a PhD degree? I\u2019m tired about hearing the cons. Thank you.","chosen":"I did mine for the silly hat","rejected":"I agree with the responses that have been given here about learning, time management, curiosity, and teaching, but since people have already mentioned these, I will focus on the pros on the long term, the ones you can take away even when the PhD finishes.  &#x200B;  1. Data Analysis: This is a very useful skill nowadays, and when you do a PhD, specially in STEM, Economics, and even some social sciences, you will have to filter, analyze, understand, extrapolate and present lots of data in order to validate you theories.  2. Project Management: Your Phd is your own project, and you will learn how to manage your timelines, deadlines, constraints, responsibilities, prioritize 3. Traveling: You can go to many conferences, and share your research with lots of people abroad."}
