{"domain":"askscience_train","prompt":"As we age and our cells accumulate mutations, is there any source within ourselves of \u201cpure, un-mutated\u201d DNA that would match our DNA from when we were a newborn?","chosen":"Kind of, neurons and heart cells are in a state of quiescence where they do not undergo division. However dna damage is still possible and the repair mechanisms can introduce mutations. Heart and neuron cells would give the best result.","rejected":"Nope. DNA replication inherently generates mutations and not all are repaired. Different cell types can acquire mutations at different rates so some cells are individually closer to the original. Since mutations are random for each individual cell, the aggregate of many cells should get you close to your original Inherited sequence."}
{"domain":"askscience_test","prompt":"What is the specific advantage of a moon base over an orbital space station? Now that several nations have developed plans for permanent installations on the moon, what is the specific advantage of building such an installation over having an identical facility floating in space?","chosen":"Mass. Every gram of everything that is needed has to be launched to an orbital space station. Structural members, radiation shielding, water, rocket fuel, ammonia, cooling system, oxygen, etc.    On a planetary body, you can get some for free (bury the station for radiation shielding), or minimal processing.  By sending up equipment to process the planetary resources, the total mass can be reduced, and you can build bigger \/ expandable stations.","rejected":"I\u2019m no expert, just having a punt here\u2026 I guess it\u2019s helpful to have a little gravity. They want to study the moon, studying the space in orbit has less to teach us. Building a base is way cheaper\/easier if you can use local materials, the moon has local materials. Water is also very neccessary and having a chance of mining it locally is much more practical at scale than rocketing it into space. Also as a human off earth I\u2019d much rather live somewhere I can go for a moon-walk than always cooped up in the same set of capsules."}
{"domain":"askengineers_train","prompt":"Is there any free solidworks software or something similar so I can get an idea of what its like to be an engineer? I have always liked building electronics and putting things together etc, but I also like programming.   Is there any free or cheap software that I can get so I can design something simple but then can have a better idea if should do a CS\/software course or engineering.   Also do engineers actually see and tinker with there designs once they are made?","chosen":"Try freeCAD or some other open source projects if you are just playing around. If you want to get used to professional tools, a lot of new companies choose auto desk fusion360 because the price is right (auto desk inventor is the flagship CAD product) you can get a free trial.   My other suggestion. Engineering in todays world is driven by software. You will be miles ahead if you do a dual program with CS. Even just learn on your own. I am mechanical but I do industrial IOT device design, it is an equal mix of software and hardware.  Even within CAD programs or Excel, you can write macros (little software scripts) that automate repetitive work. You will make your life soooo much better just having these basic software skills in engineering fields.","rejected":"Check Titans of CNC. You can buy a solidworks copy there at a good price."}
{"domain":"askengineers_train","prompt":"Did you make a lot of mistakes when first starting your job?","chosen":"I needed to discharge a cap so I shunted it to the wall outlet ground. Problem was this was a couple of Farad oil filled cap charged up to 900VDC. I violently raised the ground for all the outlets in the room and blew up every PC and piece of equipment in said room that was on the same panel. Bad day.","rejected":"Yeah and I still make mistakes 22 years later. Just not the same mistakes."}
{"domain":"askengineers_train","prompt":"What are somethings I can learn something that is related to Engineering that is not coding? I\u2019m an 8th grader that wants to learn something Engineering based before Highschool. I just don\u2019t want to learn code, because I already thought of that (thinking of learning Phyton and C++\/ C#, if you have other suggestions thanks). Any suggestions is helpful, just anything related to Engineering. Thanks.","chosen":"Circuits are a fun thing to learn. If you want a more academic subject you can look into basic physics (acceleration, force, power, etc.). You can also get really good at using Microsoft excel because you will have at least one class that is totally excel based and it\u2019s a high demand skill in almost any field. Don\u2019t get discouraged if any of that seems boring; I think a lot of it\u2019s boring and I\u2019m about to graduate college!","rejected":"Well, I'm an electronics engineer, so I'm kinda partial to electronic circuits. Circuit theory is definitely something you can start getting into at your age, and I find it much more interesting than coding. There's plenty of online resources to help you get started (like  https:\/\/www.allaboutcircuits.com\/) or you can check out *The Art of Electronics* if you want something a little more in depth."}
{"domain":"askengineers_train","prompt":"Mechanical engineers who started in or switched to HVAC design, do you enjoy it or regret it? I\u2019ve heard HVAC can be boring and less desired than most positions, but I see sooo many mechanical HVAC engineer positions open.   How is pay in HVAC?","chosen":"I've been in HVAC since I graduated back in the 90's. It kind of fell into my lap - it wasn't what I had envisioned doing when I was in school - but I like it and I'm good at it.  The good: projects can be very varied, there's a lot of room to move up, the hours are reasonable, and you can quite easily end up owning your own practice if you choose (once you're licensed).  The bad: pay starts out so-so (starting around $65-70k), you need to become licensed to start seeing lots of doors open and start making the big bucks.","rejected":"Sorry I don\u2019t have an answer, but am wondering the same thing.  I\u2019m seeing many related positions open with a possible higher average salary than my current field. They seem to me to be less interesting but would love to know more!"}
{"domain":"askengineers_validation","prompt":"Is it normal to feel like a fraud? I'm going into my second year electrical engineering at university, and I plan to hopefully get an internship during the summer. But I feel like if I get one, I will have no idea what I'm doing. I've studied a lot and done well in my classes, and I know I know the material, but I can't fight off the thought that I will not be useful at a job or internship and have no clue how to do anything. Is this normal, or is there something wrong with me?","chosen":"The thing that academia doesn't want you to know is that a new grad (and especially intern) doesn't know how to do anything yet.  You are expected to show up and do what you are told and try to learn everything you can.  In a few years you'll learn enough to figure out how to apply what they taught you in school.  I do try to find tasks that are closely related to school work when possible for interns and grads but those tasks are pretty far apart.    Show up, ask questions, lean everything you can.","rejected":"The internship is for you to learn. You're not supposed to know everything at this point in your schooling.   You're not alone. I've been working for 5 years and I still feel like I dont know what I'm doing sometimes."}
