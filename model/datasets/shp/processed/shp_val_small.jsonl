{"domain":"askphysics_train","prompt":"can someone explain how energy (electricity) is transmitted to each pixel on a phone screen \/ computer monitor? Are each pixel connected in parallel? this one needs millions of micro wires, how does it all work?","chosen":"They're set up as a grid.  Each pixels is connected + side to one axis (e.g. all the horizontal wires), and - side to the other (e.g. all the vertical wires).  So you can leave all but one row of pixels disconnected, and connect + to global positive.  Then you set all of the - values for that row of pixels.  Then you disconnect the that line, connect the  next line, and push another row of pixels.  There are various technologies and techniques depending on what, how, exactly the display works -- OLED, TFT, plasma, etc.  However, the overall concept of matrix multiplexing is basically a constant.  It means instead of ~2M connections for a 1080p screen, you only need 3000... and they're all straight lines.  Neat fact: one side is usually *above* the display element.  So it's made out of transparent conductors, IIRC usually made out of indium.","rejected":"I'm not sure if it's vertical or horizontal, but all the pixels in one row are connected by a single thread all the way down."}
{"domain":"askscience_train","prompt":"Why can green, red, and blue alone be used and combined to make every visible color, like on screens? Are there other combinations of colors that can do this?","chosen":"> Why can green, red, and blue alone be used and combined to make every visible color, like on screens?  Simple answer: they don't.  The frequencies of light used in screens correspond roughly to the peak frequencies that each of the three types of cone in our eye detect, but red is actually quite a way off peak because it would otherwise overlap too much with green, and the screen wouldn't be able to produce a pure(ish) red:  https:\/\/jakubmarian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/color-cones-bars.png  The three curving lines represent how the different cones respond to different \"pure\" frequencies of light (displayed in the spectrum below the graph).  So if you draw a line up from the spectrum, those are the \"heights\" of RGB which you would need to see the colour. But the screen can only display the three specific frequencies shown.  So the screen needs to try and replicate the combination of RGB values.  Imagine a line halfway between the thick blue and green lines. To see this colour, you want roughly equal amounts of green and blue, plus a bit of red. That's most easily done by only using the blue and green pixels, since green pixels stimulate red cones anyway.  To make yellow, you would use full green (which also simulates red) but then you need some more red to make sure red is above green. You only want a bit, but then the red frequency used in screens is far off-peak, so you would turn it on more or less full.  Now, far off to the left are some spectral colours which simulate both blue cones and red cones, but not green cones. These are hard for displays to replicate without stimulating green cones (the red frequency still stimulates a bit of green), so it's hard to get a nice deep violet from a display. That's one reason why sunset photos always look so disappointing compared to real life.","rejected":"This actually has a bit to do with biology. Inside your eyes, there are three types of cones: L (for long) which detects light on the red side of spectrum, M (for medium) which detects light in the green\/middle of the spectrum, and S (for short) detecting blue light. Pixels have three colors, because you only have three types of cones. They use red, green, and blue because that's how your eyes work"}
{"domain":"askscience_train","prompt":"Some COVID-10 vaccine candidates (e.g. Oxford) use Adenovirus as a vector to transport mRNA of Sars-CoV-2's spike protein. What if the recipient of such vaccine had a prior infection of that adenovirus and now has immunity against it, will the vaccine still work? if so, how?","chosen":"Pre-existing immunity to the adenovirus vector was a major concern in the 2000s. In one of the earliest adenovirus vaccine studies, they found that subjects that had been previously exposed to the vector responded much more poorly than those that had not previously been exposed. Source. These results were replicated in a number of other disease models. Part of the issue is that your pre-existing immunity essentially clears the vaccine too fast. Generally speaking, the faster a pathogen is cleared, the weaker your lasting immunity will be.  That being said, in the past decade they\u2019ve developed a number of strategies to circumvent this issue. For example, coating the adenovirus particle in polyethylene glycol essentially masks it from pre-existing antibodies. Source.  Similarly, various methods of encapsulating the adenovirus, for example in lipid vesicles, have been developed to circumvent antibody-mediated immunity.  Another strategy is to simply use a non-human primate adenovirus strain that isn\u2019t found natively in humans. The problem with this strategy is that if multiple different vaccines use this same strain, then immunization with one vaccine may affect the efficacy of the next. This is the strategy employed by the Oxford vaccine. Not sure if it employs others because I\u2019m not following too closely.  Yet another strategy is to simply modify the region of the adenovirus vector that your body develops immunity to. Source.  Anyways that\u2019s about all I know on the topic. Hopefully there was something useful\/interesting in there.  Edit: So to directly answer your question, no this shouldn\u2019t be a concern in the immediate future because nobody should have pre-existing immunity to a chimp adenovirus. However, in the long-run there could be issues if future vaccines choose to use the same adenovirus strain.","rejected":"I can't answer your question at large, but I will point out that your example, the Oxford vaccine candidate, uses a chimpanzee derived adenovirus (hence the \"Ch\" in the original name for the candidate, \"ChAdOx1\") with the aim of circumventing the very issue at the center of your question."}

The ability for the shuttle to do polar orbits for the military from vandenburg drove a lot of the design requirements (like the double delta wings so that it have enough x-range to land in FL on Re-entry) and it was an ability that the shuttle never used. The RS-25 engine had a very high isp (efficiency) but at the cost of complexity to the point where you basically had to rebuild the engines after each mission; which dashed any hopes of the advertised turn around time of 1-2 weeks.

I'm hiring some new staff and there are a number of applicants that have been in their current position for a year or maybe two.

If you REALLY want someone who MIGHT be staying really long, you want someone who has a family (children), is taking a large risk, or  things along that line of though. This has nothing to do with their skillset though.  The other reality is that people with experience only need 1 other company to think they are worth more than their current salary. How many engineering companies exist? A lot.   I only need 1 of them to offer a 10k~20k higher salary and I'll be gone.

{"domain":"askscience_train","prompt":"Is it possible for a planet to have only ONE polar ice cap?

I'm doing this for worldbuilding, & the ice cap is at the southern part of the planet.","chosen":"With a highly elliptical orbit, the proximity of the planet to the sun at periapsis could increase the total heat to the planet while the north pole is in winter, keeping the north pole from freezing over.  Southern winter occurring during the apoapsis could be significantly colder.","rejected":"Some people here have mentioned tidally locked planets, but I would say the dark side of a tidally locked planet isn't the same thing as a pole. The poles are defined by the rotational axis of a body, not necessarily where it's coldest.  Theoretically, a rocky planet spinning like Uranus would fit the bill. Since the rotational axis of Uranus lies roughly in the plane of its orbit, one pole is in perpetual sunlight for half its year and the other pole is in perpetual darkness for that time. Of course, they switch every half-year, so whichever pole is dark and frozen would alternate, but it would generally be only 1 ice cap at a time (except during the transition period)."}

I hooked a friend's AC (Florida) into a hundred or so feet of copper coiled in a 30 gallon barrel connected to his pool.   His pool still stays below air temperature in daytime. Cooling worked so well we bypassed the condenser entirely.  Seems like every school, community center, hotel, and residential house with a pool or a pond should be doing this. Only downside is that the copper is being electroplated by the metals in the water from the sacrificial anode and we have to powerwash them every so often.  Is the system going to explode one day?   I ask because he wants to use it as a heat pump this year and asked me to install reversing hardware.

A:  What sorts of units can provide high humidity air this close to freezing?  Most AC units provide air at temperatures colder than the set point, but in that case I would get freezing on the air exchange.

C: If ground chilling is the answer, how do I properly make foundations?  &#x200B;  Comment inspire by Comfortable\\_ad\\_9527  &#x200B;  Freezing or condensing water vapour out of the internal air lowers the humidity.
