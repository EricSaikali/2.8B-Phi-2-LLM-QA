The sum of the first $n$ even integers is given by $n(n+1)$. Thus, $m^{2}=n^{2}+n+212$. Since we want to solve for $n$, rearrange as a quadratic equation: $n^{2}+n+\\left(212-m^{2}\\right)=0$. Use the quadratic formula: $n=\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{1-4\\left(212-m^{2}\\right)}}{2}$. Since $n$ is clearly an integer, $1-4\\left(212-m^{2}\\right)=4 m^{2}-847$ must be not only a perfect square, but also an odd perfect square for $n$ to be an integer.  Let $x=\\sqrt{4 m^{2}-847}$; note that this means $n=\\frac{-1+x}{2}$. It can be rewritten as $x^{2}=4 m^{2}-847$, so $4 m^{2}-x^{2}=847$. Factoring the left side by using the difference of squares, we get $(2 m+x)(2 m-x)=847=7 \\cdot 11^{2}$. Our goal is to find possible values for $x$, then use the equation above to find $n$. The difference between the factors is $(2 m+x)-(2 m-x)=2 m+x-2 m+x=2 x$. We have three pairs of factors, $847 \\cdot 1,121 \\cdot 7$, and $77 \\cdot 11$. The differences between these factors are 846,114 , and 66 - those are all possible values for $2 x$. Thus the possibilities for $x$ are 423,57 , and 33 . Now plug in these values into the equation $n=\\frac{-1+x}{2}$, so $n$ can equal 211,28 , or 16 , hence the answer is 255 . "}

{"id":886,"question":"Each of the 5 sides and the 5 diagonals of a regular pentagon are randomly and independently colored red or blue with equal probability. What is the probability that there will be a triangle whose vertices are among the vertices of the pentagon such that all of its sides have the same color? \n\nOptions:\nA. $\\frac{2}{3}$ \nB. $\\frac{105}{128}$ \nC. $\\frac{125}{128}$ \nD. $\\frac{253}{256}$ \nE. $$1$$ ","answer":"D","answer_text":"Instead of finding the probability of a same-colored triangle appearing, let us find the probability that one does not appear. After drawing the regular pentagon out, note the topmost vertex; it has $4$ sides\/diagonals emanating outward from it. We do casework on the color distribution of these sides\/diagonals.  Case 1: all $4$ are colored one color. In that case, all of the remaining sides must be of the other color to not have a triangle where all three sides are of the same color. We can correspondingly fill out each color based on this constraint, but in this case you will always end up with a triangle where all three sides have the same color by inspection.  Case $2$: $3$ are one color and one is the other. Following the steps from the previous case, you can try filling out the colors, but will always arrive at a contradiction so this case does not work either.  Case $3$: $2$ are one color and $2$ are of the other color. Using the same logic as previously, we can color the pentagon $2$ different ways by inspection to satisfy the requirements. There are $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}4 \\textbackslash\\textbackslash{} 2\\end{array}\\right)$ ways to color the original sides\/diagonals and 2 ways after that to color the remaining ones for a total of $6 \\cdot 2=12$ ways to color the pentagon so that no such triangle has the same color for all of its sides. These are all the cases, and there are a total of $2^{10}$ ways to color the pentagon. Therefore the answer is $1-\\frac{12}{1024}=1-\\frac{3}{256}=\\frac{253}{256}=D$. "}
