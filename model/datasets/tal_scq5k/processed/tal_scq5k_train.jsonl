Because $a, b, c$ are in arithmetic progression, $b-a=c-b$, or $b=\\frac{a+c}{2}$. We need to find the unique root, or $-\\frac{b}{2 a}$ (discriminant is 0 ). From $b^{2}=4 a c$, we can get $-\\frac{b}{2 a}=-\\frac{2 c}{b}$ Ignoring the negatives(for now), we have $\\frac{2 c}{b}=\\frac{2 c}{\\frac{a+c}{2}}=\\frac{4 c}{a+c}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\frac{4 c}{a+c}}}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{a+c}{4 c}}=\\frac{1}{\\frac{a}{4 c}+\\frac{1}{4}}$. Fortunately, finding $\\frac{a}{c}$ is not very hard. Plug in $b=\\frac{a+c}{2}$ to $b^{2}=4 a c$, we have $a^{2}+2 a c+c^{2}=16 a c$, or $a^{2}-14 a c+c^{2}=0$, and dividing by $c^{2}$ gives $\\left(\\frac{a}{c}\\right)^{2}-14\\left(\\frac{a}{c}\\right)+1=0$, so $\\frac{a}{c}=\\frac{14 \\pm \\sqrt{192}}{2}=7 \\pm 4 \\sqrt{3}$.

The balance has two situations: balanced or not.  Analyze the situation of the balance: if balanced, the fake coin is among the remaining $$4$$ coins.  In the second weighing with the balance, randomly take $$3$$ coins from coin $$1$$ to coin $$8$$ and put them on the left end of the balance and randomly take $$3$$ coins from coin $$9$$ to coin $$12$$ and put them on the right end of the balance (such as $$9$$, $$10$$, $$11$$). The balance also has two situations: balanced or not.  If balanced, coin $$12$$ is the coin of different weight. In the third weighing with the balance, comparing No. $$12$$ coin with any other coin, whether the coin is lighter or heavier can be known.  If not, it can be known that the coin of different weight is among the three coins $$9$$, $$10$$, and $$11$$, and that whether it is lighter or heavier than other coins can be known. In the third weighing with the balance, randomly take two of the coins (such as $$9$$ and $$10$$) and put them on the both ends of the balance. If balanced, the remaining coin (coin $$11$$) is the one we are looking for; if not, based on the previous judgement that whether the coin is lighter or heavier, it can be determined that which one of the coins on the balance is what we are looking for.  Analyze the first imbalanced situation as follows:  There are two situations: the right end weighs more or the left end weighs more. Assume the left end weighs more (which is the same for the situation that the right end weighs more.)  In the second weighing with the balance, take off $$3$$ coins randomly from the left end (such as $$1$$, $$2$$, and $$3$$) and move $$3$$ coins from the right end to the left end (such as $$5$$, $$6$$, and $$7$$), then take $$3$$ coins randomly from the $$4$$ coins left in the first weighing (such as $$9$$, $$10$$, and $$11$$) to the right end, and there sees $$3$$ situations for the balance: \u2460 the left end weighs more, \u2461 the two ends strike a balance, \u2462 the right end weighs more. Analyze the situations one by one as follows:  \u2460 If the left end weighs more, the coin we are looking for must be coin $$4$$ or coin $$8$$. In the third time weighing with the balance, take one of the coins (such as coin $$4$$) and put it on the left end of the balance. Randomly take one of the remaining $$10$$ coins and put it on the right end. There are also $$3$$ situations.  $$a$$: If balanced, coin $$8$$ is the one we are looking for. Based on the result of using the balance for the second time, it is known that the coin weighs less than other coins.  $$b$$: If the left end weighs more, coin $$4$$ is the one we are looking for and it weighs more than other coins.  $$c$$: If the right end weighs more, coin $$4$$ is the one we are looking for and it weighs less than other coins.  \u2461 If the two ends strike a balance, the coin we are looking for is among the three coins ($$1$$, $$2$$, and $$3$$) taken from the left end. Since the left end weighs more in the first weighing, it is known that the coin weighs more than other coins. The following analysis is the same as previous one and will not be repeated.  \u2462 If the right end weighs more, the coin we are looking for is among the three coins ($$5$$, $$6$$, and $$7$$) moved from the right end to the left end.

What is the sum of all possible values of $n$? \n\nOptions:\nA. $$255$$ \nB. $$256$$ \nC. $$257$$ \nD. $$258$$ \nE. $$259$$ ","answer":"A","answer_text":"The sum of the first $m$ odd integers is given by $m^{2}$. The sum of the first $n$ even integers is given by $n(n+1)$. Thus, $m^{2}=n^{2}+n+212$. Since we want to solve for $n$, rearrange as a quadratic equation: $n^{2}+n+\\left(212-m^{2}\\right)=0$. Use the quadratic formula: $n=\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{1-4\\left(212-m^{2}\\right)}}{2}$. Since $n$ is clearly an integer, $1-4\\left(212-m^{2}\\right)=4 m^{2}-847$ must be not only a perfect square, but also an odd perfect square for $n$ to be an integer.  Let $x=\\sqrt{4 m^{2}-847}$; note that this means $n=\\frac{-1+x}{2}$. It can be rewritten as $x^{2}=4 m^{2}-847$, so $4 m^{2}-x^{2}=847$. Factoring the left side by using the difference of squares, we get $(2 m+x)(2 m-x)=847=7 \\cdot 11^{2}$. Our goal is to find possible values for $x$, then use the equation above to find $n$. The difference between the factors is $(2 m+x)-(2 m-x)=2 m+x-2 m+x=2 x$. We have three pairs of factors, $847 \\cdot 1,121 \\cdot 7$, and $77 \\cdot 11$. The differences between these factors are 846,114 , and 66 - those are all possible values for $2 x$. Thus the possibilities for $x$ are $423$, $57$, and $33$. Now plug in these values into the equation $n=\\frac{-1+x}{2}$, so $n$ can equal $211$, $28$, or $16$, hence the answer is $255$. ","choices":["$$255$$ ","$$256$$ ","$$257$$ ","$$258$$ ","$$259$$ "]}

{"id":675,"question":"What is the average (mean) of all $$5-$$digit numbers that can be formed by using each of the digits $$1$$, $$3$$, $$5$$, $$7$$, and $$8$$ exactly once? ($$2005$$ AMC $$10B$$ Problem, Question \\#$$20$$) \n\nOptions:\nA. $$48000$$ \nB. $$49999.5$$ \nC. $$53332.8$$ \nD. $$55555$$ \nE. $$56432.8$$ ","answer":"C","answer_text":"Method $$1$$: We first look at how many times each number will appear in each slot. If we fix a number in a slot, then there are $$4!=24$$ ways to arrange the other numbers, so each number appears in each spot $$24$$ times. Therefore, the sum of all such numbers is $$24\\times (1+3+5+7+8)\\times (11111)=24\\times24\\times11111=6399936$$.  Since there are $$5!=120$$ such numbers, we divide $$6399936\\div120$$~ to get $$53332.8$$.  Method $$2$$: We can first solve for the mean for the digits $$1$$, $$3$$, $$5$$, $$7$$, and $$9$$ since each is $$2$$ away from each other. The mean of the numbers than can be solved using these digits is $$55555$$. The total amount of numbers that can be formed using these digits is $$5!=120$$. The sum of these numbers is $$55555(120)=6666600$$. Now we can find out the total value that was gained by replacing the $$8$$ with a $$9$$. We can start by calculating the gain when the $$8$$ was in the ones digit. Since there are $$4!=24$$ numbers with the $$8$$ in the ones digit and $$1$$ was gain from each of them, $$24$$ is the number gained. Then, we repeat this with the tens, hundreds, thousands, and ten thousands place, leading to a total of $$24+240+2400+24000+240000=266664$$ as the total amount that was gained. Subtract this amount from the sum of the digits using the~ $$9$$ instead of the $$8$$ to get $$6666600-266664=6399936$$. Finally, we divide this by $$120$$ to get the average $$\\frac{6399936}{120}=53332.8$$.  Method $$3$$: The average value of the digits is $$\\frac{(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 8)}{5} = 4.8$$.
